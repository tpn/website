Einstein's Theory of Relativity states that the speed of
light in a vacuum is simply the speed of the electrons in
that vacuum, since light has a speed. Since the speed of
light in a vacuum is equal to the speed of the electrons in
a solid, the light from this source has a speed of
approximately 1/299,792 m/s. Einstein's theory of relativity
explains this speed by a phenomenon known as the speed at
the end of time. In other words, this speed is

Einstein's Theory of Relativity states that the speed of
light in a vacuum is simply the speed of the electrons in
that vacuum, since light has a speed. Since the speed of
light in a vacuum is equal to the speed of the electrons in
a solid, the light from this source has a speed of
approximately 1/299,792 m/s. Einstein's theory of relativity
explains this speed by a phenomenon known as the speed at

Einstein's Theory of Relativity states that the speed of
light in a vacuum is simply the speed of the electrons in
that vacuum, since light has a speed. Since the speed of
light in a vacuum is equal to the speed of the electrons in
a solid, the light from this source has a speed of
approximately 1/299,792 m/s. Einstein's theory of relativity
explains this speed by a phenomenon known as the speed at

Einstein's Theory of Relativity states that the speed of
light in a vacuum is simply the speed of the electrons in
that vacuum, since light has a speed. Since the speed of
light in a vacuum is equal to the speed of the electrons in
a solid, the light from this source has a speed of
approximately 1/299,792 m/s. Einstein's theory of relativity
explains this speed by a phenomenon known as the speed at
the end of time. In other words, this speed is
