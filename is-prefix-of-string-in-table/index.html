                <hr/>
                <h2>TL;DR</h2>
                <p>

                    Goal: given a string, determine if it prefix-matches a set of known strings as
                    fast as possible.  That is, in a set of known strings, do any of them prefix
                    match the incoming search string?

                </p>
                <p>

                    A reference implementation was written in C as a <a
                    href="#IsPrefixOfCStrInArray">baseline</a>, which simply looped
                    through an array of strings, comparing each one, byte-by-byte, looking for a
                    prefix match.  Prefix match performance ranged from 28 CPU cycles to 130, and
                    negative match performance was around 74 cycles.

                </p>
                <p>

                    A SIMD-friendly C structure called <a href="#STRING_TABLE">STRING_TABLE</a> was
                    derived.  It is optimized for up to 16 strings, ideally of length less than or
                    equal 16 characters.  The table is created from the set of known strings
                    up-front; it is sorted by length, ascending, and a unique character (with
                    regards to other characters at the same byte offset) is then extracted, along
                    with its index.  A 16 byte character array, <a
                    href="#STRING_SLOT">STRING_SLOT</a>, is used to capture the unique characters.
                    A 16 element array of unsigned characters, SLOT_INDEX, is used to capture the
                    index.  Similarly, lengths are stored in the same fashion via SLOT_LENGTHS.
                    Finally, a 16 element array of STRING_SLOTs is used to capture up to the first
                    16 bytes of each string in the set.

                </p>

                <p>

                    An example of the memory layout of the STRING_TABLE structure at run time, using
                    sample <a href="#ntfs-reserved-names">test data</a>, is depicted below.  Note
                    the width of each row is 16 bytes (128 bits), which is the size of an XMM register.

                </p>

                    <img class="svg-image" src="StringTable.svg"/>
                </a>

                </picture>
                -->

                <p>
                    The layout of the STRING_TABLE structure allows us to determine if a given
                    search string <strong>does not</strong> prefix match all 16 strings at once
                    in 12 assembly instructions.  This breaks down into 18 &#181;ops, with a
                    block throughput of 3.48 cycles on Intel's Skylake architecture:

                <p>

                    Here's a simplified walk-through of a negative match in action,
                    using the search string "CAT":

                    <a href="StringTable-NegativeMatch-v3.svg" target="_blank">
                        <img class="svg-image" src="StringTable-NegativeMatch-v3.svg"/>
                    </a>

                </p>

                <p>

                    Ten iterations of a function named IsPrefixOfStringInTable were authored.  The
                    <a href="#IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10">tenth</a> and final iteration was the
                    fastest, prefix matching in as little as 19 cycles &mdash; a 4x improvement over
                    the baseline.  Negative matching took 11 cycles &mdash; a 6.7x improvement.

                </p>

                <p>

                    An <a
                    href="#IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_2">assembly</a>
                    version of the algorithm was authored specifically to optimize for the negative
                    match case, and was able to do so in as little as 8 cycles, representing a 9x
                    improvement over the baseline.  (It was a little bit slower than the fastest
                    C routine in the case of prefix matches, though, as can be seen above.)

                </p>

                <p>

                    <small>
                    (Feedback for an early draft of this article was then solicited on <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/trentnelson/status/985715037934440448">Twitter</a>,
                    resulting in three more iterations of the C version, and two more iterations
                    of the assembly version.  The PGO build of the fastest C version (thirteenth
                    attempt) prefix matched in about 16 cycles (and also had the best "worst case
                    input string" performance (where three slots needed comparison), negative
                    matching in about 26 cycles).  The fifth iteration of the assembly version
                    negative matched in about 6 cycles, a 3 and 1 cycle improvement, respectively.
                    Now, I could re-do these intro graphs, or you could just picture the ones above
                    with a few more bars, slightly shorter in length than their nearest counterparts,
                    and then I won't have to.)

                <h1>The Background</h1>

                <h2>The Tracer Project</h2>
                <p>

                    One of the frustrations I had with existing Python profilers was that there was
                    no easy or efficient means to filter or exclude trace information based on the module
                    name of the code being executed.  I tackled this in my
                    <a href="https://github.com/tpn/tracer">tracer</a> project, which allows you to
                    set an environment variable named TRACER_MODULE_NAMES to restrict which modules
                    should be traced, e.g.:
                    <small><pre>set TRACER_MODULE_NAMES=myproject1;myproject2;myproject3.subproject;numpy;pandas;scipy</pre></small>

                </p>

                <p>

                    If the code being executed is coming from the module
                    <small><code>myproject3.subproject.foo</code></small>,
                    then we need to trace it, as that string <strong>prefix matches</strong>
                    the third entry on our list.

                </p>

                <p>

                    This article details the custom data structure and algorithm I came up with in
                    order to try and solve the prefix matching problem more optimally with a SIMD
                    approach.  The resulting <a
                    href="https://github.com/tpn/tracer/tree/master/StringTable2">StringTable</a>
                    component is used extensively within the tracer project, and as such, must
                    conform to unique constraints such as no use of the C runtime library and
                    allocating all memory through TraceStore-backed allocators.  Thus, it's not
                    really something you'd drop in to your current project in its current form.
                    Hopefully, the article still proves to be interesting.

                </p>

                    <p>

                        Note: the code samples provided herein are copied directly from the tracer
                        project, which is written in C and assembly, and uses the Pascal-esque
                        <em>Cutler Normal Form</em> style for C.  If you're used to the more UNIX-style
                        <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9">
                        <em>Kernel Normal Form</em></a> of C, it's quite like that, except that it's
                        absolutely nothing like that, and all these code samples will probably be
                        very jarring.  And if that doesn't put you off, there's zero support at the
                        moment for running on anything other than Windows, including these
                        benchmarks.  How's that for alienating most of your article's audience up
                        front!

                <h2>Baseline C Implementation</h2>

                <p>

                    The simplest way of solving this in C is to have an array of C strings (i.e.
                    NULL terminated byte arrays), then for each string, loop through byte by byte
                    and see if it prefix matches the search string.

                    Another type of code pattern that the string table attempts to replace is
                    anything that does a lot of if/else if/else if-type string comparisons to
                    look for keywords.  For example, in the

                    Quake III</a> source, there's some symbol/string processing logic that looks
                    like this:

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

                    All implementations discussed in this article adhere to that function signature.
                    The <a href="#STRING_TABLE">STRING_TABLE</a> structure will be discussed shortly.

                <p>

                    The STRING_MATCH structure is used to optionally communicate information about
                    the prefix match back to the caller.  The index and characters matched fields
                    are often very useful when using the string table for text parsing; see the <a
                    href="#other-applications">other applications</a> section below for an example.

                <h2>The Test Data</h2>

                <p>

                    Instead of using some arbitrary Python module names, this article is going to
                    focus on a string table constructed out of a set of 16 strings that represent
                    reserved names of the NTFS file system, at least when it was first released
                    way back in the early 90s.

                </p>

                <p>

                    This list is desirable as it has good distribution of characters, there is
                    a good mix of both short and long entries, plus one oversized one
                    ($INDEX_ALLOCATION, which clocks in at 17 characters), and almost all
                    strings lead with a common character (the dollar sign), preventing a simple
                    <em>first character</em> optimization used by <a href="https://github.com/tpn/tracer/blob/2018-04-18.1/StringTable/StringTable.h#L324">
                    the initial version of the StringTable component I wrote in 2016</a>.

                </p>
                <p>

                    So the scenario we'll be emulating, in this case, is that we've just been passed
                    a filename for creation, and we need to check if it prefix matches any of the
                    reserved names.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Here's the full list of NTFS names we'll be using.  We're assuming 8-bit ASCII
                    encoding (no UTF-8) and case sensitive.  (If this were actually the NT kernel,
                    we'd need to use wide characters with UTF-16 enconding, and be
                    case-insensitive.)

                <h3>NTFS Reserved Names</h3>

                <p>

                    The ordering is important in certain cases.  For example, when you have
                    overlapping strings, such as $MftMirr, and $Mft, you should put the longest
                    strings first.  They will be matched first, and as our routine terminates upon
                    the first successful prefix match &mdash; if a longer string resided after a
                    shorter one, it would never get detected.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Let's review some guiding design requirements and cover some of the design
                    decisions I made, which should help shape your understanding of the
                    implementation.

                <p>

                    The STRING struct will be used to capture incoming search strings as well as the
                    representation of any strings registered in the table (or more accurately, in
                    the corresponding StringArray structure associated with the string table.

    USHORT Length;
    USHORT MaximumLength;
    ULONG  Padding;
    PCHAR Buffer;
} STRING, *PSTRING;
typedef const STRING *PCSTRING;
</code></pre>

                <p>

                    The design should optimize for string lengths less than or equal to 16.  Lengths
                    greater than 16 are permitted, up to 128 bytes, but they incur more overhead during
                    the prefix lookup.

                </p>

                <p>

                    The design should prioritize the fast-path code where there is no match for a
                    given search string.  Being able to terminate the search as early as possible is
                    ideal.

                </p>

                <p>

                    The performance hits taken by unaligned data access are non-nelgible, especially
                    when dealing with XMM/YMM loads.  Pay special care to alignment constrants and
                    make sure that everything under our control is aligned on a suitable boundary.

                    (The only thing we can't really control in the real world is the alignment of
                    the incoming search string buffer, which will often be at undesirable alignments
                    like 2, 4, 6, etc.  Our test program explicitly aligns the incoming search
                    strings on 32-byte boundaries to avoid the penalties associated with unaligned
                    access.)

                </p>

                <p>

                    The string table is geared toward a single-shot build.  Once you've created it
                    with a given string array or used a delimited environment variable, that's it.
                    There are no AddString() or RemoveString() routines.  The order you provided the
                    strings in will be the same order the table uses &mdash; no re-ordering will be
                    done.  Thus, for prefix matching purposes, if two strings share a common prefix,
                    the longer one should go first, as the prefix search routine will check it first.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Only single matches are performed; the first match that qualifies as a prefix
                    match (target string in table had length less than or equal to the search
                    string, and all of its characters matched).  There is no support for obtaining
                    multiple matches &mdash; if you've constructed your string tables properly
                    (no duplicate or incorrectly-ordered overlapping fields), you shouldn't need to.

                </p>

                <p>
                    So, to summarise, the design guidelines are as follows.

                    <ul>

                        <li>

                            Prioritize fast-path exit in the non-matched case.  (I refer to this as
                            <strong>negative matching</strong> in a lot of places.)

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            Optimize for up to 16 string slots, where each slot has up to 16
                            characters, ideally.  It can have up to 128 in total, however, any bytes
                            outside of the first sixteen live in the string array structure
                            supporting the string table (accessible via pStringArray).

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            If a slot is longer than 16 characters, optimize for the assumption that
                            it won't be *that* much longer.  i.e. assume a string of length 18 bytes
                            is more common than 120 bytes.

                        </li>

                    </ul>
               </p>

                <h1>The Data Structures</h1>

                <p>

                    The primary data structure employed by this solution is the STRING_TABLE
                    structure.  It is composed of supporting structures: STRING_SLOT, SLOT_INDEX and
                    SLOT_LENGTH, and either embeds or points to the originating STRING_ARRAY
                    structure from which it was created.

                </p>

                    In order to improve the uniqueness of the unique characters selected from each
                    string, the strings are sorted by length during string table creation and
                    enumerated in this order whilst identifying unique characters.  The rationale
                    behind this is that shorter strings simply have fewer characters to choose from,
                    longer strings have more to choose from.  If we identified unique characters in
                    the order they appear in the string table, we may have longer strings preceeding
                    shorter ones, such that toward the end of the table, nothing unique can be
                    extracted from the short ones.

                </p>

                <p>

                    The utility of the string table is maximised by ensuring a unique character is
                    selected from every string, thus, we sort by length first.  Note that the
                    uniqueness is actually determined by offset:character pairs, with the offsets
                    becoming the indices stored in the <em>UniqueIndex</em> slot.  If you trace
                    through the diagram above, you'll see that the unique character in each slot
                    matches the character in the corresponding string slot, indicated by the
                    underlying index.

                The string array captures a raw array representation of the underlying strings
                making up the string table.  It is either embedded within the padding area at the
                end of the string table, or a separate allocation is made during string table
                creation.  The main interface to creating a string table is via a STRING_ARRAY
                structure.  The helper functions,

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

    This version is based off version 8, but rewrites the inner loop that checks
    for comparisons.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

    //  3. Broadcast the search string's length into an XMM register.

    //  3. Load the string table's slot lengths array into an XMM register.

    //  4. Compare the unique character from step 1 to the string table's unique
    //     character array set up in step 2.  The result of this comparison
    //     will produce an XMM register with each byte set to either 0xff if

    //  5. Compare the search string's length from step 3 to the string table's

                    href="https://github.com/tpn/tracer/blob/2018-04-18.2/StringTable2/IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_1.asm#L25">
                    IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_1</a> that simply dealt with the negative match
                    fast-path.  That is, it correctly returned NO_MATCH_FOUND if the unique
                    character and length vectors did not corroborate with the incoming search
                    string.

                </p>

                <p>

                    However, it also returned NO_MATCH_FOUND if there was a corroboration
                    (requiring a comparison against each slot matched in the bitmap).  So, it wasn't
                    particularly useful other than evaluating how fast we could get the negative
                    match case.

                </p>

                <p>

                    But as far as proof-of-concepts go, it was very effective, indicating that the
                    negative match could be done in as little as about 12 instructions and ~6-7-ish
                    CPU cycles, depending on which way the wind was blowing.  The disassembly for
                    this initial test looks like this:

                <p>

                    Implementing it as a LEAF_ENTRY bit me in the ass when it came time to implement
                    the second version, which I wanted to keep identical to the first version,
                    except, you know, have it work.

                </p>

                <p>

                    A bit of background information first.  The Windows x64 ABI and calling
                    convention dictates there are two types of functions:
                    <a
                    href="https://github.com/tpn/winsdk-10/blob/master/Include/10.0.16299.0/shared/macamd64.inc#L524">
                    NESTED_ENTRY</a> and
                    <a href="https://github.com/tpn/winsdk-10/blob/master/Include/10.0.16299.0/shared/macamd64.inc#L353">
                    LEAF_ENTRY</a>.  NESTED_ENTRY is by far the most common; C and C++ functions are
                    all implicitly NESTED_ENTRY functions.  (The LEAF_ENTRY and NESTED_ENTRY symbols
                    are MASM (ml64.exe) macro names, but the concept applies to all languages.)

                </p>

                <p>

                    A LEAF_ENTRY can only be implemented in assembly.  It is constrained in that it
                    may not manipulate any of the non-volatile x64 registers (rbx, rdi, rsi, rsp,
                    rbp, r12, r13, r14, r15, xmm6-15), nor may it call any other functions (because
                    call implicitly modifies the stack pointer), nor may it have a structured
                    exception handler (because that also manipulates the stack pointer).

                </p>

                <p>

                    The reason behind all of these constraints is that LEAF_ENTRY routines do not
                    have any unwind information generated for them in their runtime function
                    entries.  Unwind information is used by the kernel to do just that, unwind
                    the modifications made to non-volatile registers whilst traversing back up
                    through the call stack looking for an exception handler in the case of an
                    exception.

                </p>

                <p>

                    For example, here's the function entry and associated unwind information for the
                    IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10 function:

                    We can see that the C version of our routine manipulates 9 non-volatile
                    registers in total, including the stack pointer.  The first instructions
                    of the C version constitute the function's prologue; in the disassembly,
                    you can see that four of the rxx registers are pushed to the stack and then
                    0x28 (40) bytes of stack space is allocated:

                <p>

                    With our LEAF_ENTRY version, though, we don't need to push anything to the stack
                    as we won't be manipulating any non-volatile registers.  If an exception occurs
                    within the body of our implementation (say we dereference a NULL pointer), the
                    kernel knows it doesn't have to undo any non-volatile register modifications
                    (using offsets specified by the unwind information) because there isn't any
                    unwind information.  It can simply advance to the frame before us (e.g. rsp at
                    the time of the fault, minus 8 bytes) as it continues its search for runtime
                    function entries and associated unwind information.  As you can see, there is
                    no unwind information:

                    Now, the problem with a LEAF_ENTRY for anything more than a trivial bit of code
                    is that you only have a handful of volatile registers to work with, and no stack
                    space can be used for register spilling or temporaries.  (There's a nice little
                    32 byte home parameter space trailing the return address that is intended for
                    routines to stash the four parameter variables, rcx, rdx, r8, and r9, but I
                    didn't use this; I figured if I was going to the trouble of avoiding stack
                    spills I may as well try avoid all memory spills.)

                </p>

                <p>

                    So, the good news is that the completed version 2 of the assembly routine
                    worked, and basically maintained the negative match performance of the first
                    attempt, maybe save for a cycle or two.  Even still, it consistently hovers
                    around 8 cycles for negative matches, which is 3-4 cycles better than our
                    fastest C version.  It was simultaneously fun, challenging, and tedious to
                    write.  To get around the limited registers, I ended up spilling to XMM
                    registers via vpinsr/vpextr combinations, as can be seen below.

                <p>

                    The performance comparison graphs in the subsequent sections were generated in
                    Excel, using CSV data output by the creatively-named program
                    <a href="https://github.com/tpn/tracer/blob/2018-04-18.2/StringTable2BenchmarkExe/main.c#L227">
                    StringTable2BenchmarkExe</a>.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Modern CPUs are fast, timing is hard, especially when you're dealing with CPU
                    cycle comparisons.  No approach is perfect.  Here's what I settled on:

                    <ul>

                        <li>

                            The benchmark utility has <code>#pragma optimize("", off)</code> at the
                            start of the file, which disables global optimizations, even in release
                            (optimized) builds.  This prevents the compiler doing clever things with
                            regards to scheduling of the timestamping logic, which affects reported
                            times.

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            The benchmark utility pins itself to a single core and sets its thread
                            priority to the highest permissible value at startup.  (Turbo is
                            disabled on the computer, such that the frequency is pinned to 3.68GHz.)

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            The benchmark utility is fed an array of function pointers and test
                            inputs.  It iterates over each test input, and then iterates over
                            each function, calling it with the test input and potentially verifying
                            the result (some functions are included for comparison purposes but
                            don't actually produce correct results, and thus, do not have their
                            results verified).

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            The test input string is copied into a local buffer that is aligned on a
                            32 byte boundary.  This ensures that all test inputs are being compared
                            fairly.  (The natural alignment of the buffers varies anywhere from 2 to
                            512 bytes, unaligned buffers have a significant impact on the timings.)

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            The function is run once, with the result captured.  If verification has
                            been requested, the result is verified.  We <code>__debugbreak()</code>
                            immediately if there's a mismatch, which is handy during development.

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <code>NtDelayExecution(TRUE, 1)</code> is called, which results in a sleep of
                            approximately 100 nanoseconds.  This is done to force a context switch,
                            such that the thread gets a new scheduling quantum before each function
                            is run.

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            The function is executed 100 times for warmup.

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            Timings are taken for 1000 iterations of the function using the given
                            test input.  The <code>__rdtscp()</code> intrinsic is used (which forces
                            some serialization) to capture the timestamp counter before and after the
                            iterations.

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            This process is repeated 100 times.  The minimum time observed to
                            perform 1000 iterations (out of 100 attempts) is captured as the
                            function's best time.

                        </li>

                    </ul>

                </p>

                <h4>Release vs PGO Oddities</h4>

                <p>

                    All of the times in the graphs come from the profile-guided optimization build
                    of the StringTable component.  The PGO build is faster than the normal release
                    build in every case, except one, where it is notably slower.

                </p>

                <p>

                    It's... odd.  I haven't investigated it.  The following graph depicts the
                    affected function, IsPrefixOfStringInTable_1, and a few other versions for
                    reference, and depicts the performance of the PGO build to the release build on
                    the input strings "$INDEX_ALLOCATION" and "$Bai123456789012".

                </p>

                <a href="Benchmark-Release-vs-PGO-v3.svg" target="_blank">
                    <img class="svg-image" src="Benchmark-Release-vs-PGO-v3.svg"/>
                </a>

                <p>

                    Only that function is affected, and the problem really only manifests on
                    the two example test strings depicted.  As this routine essentially serves
                    as one of the initial baseline implementations, it would be misleading to
                    compare all of our optimized PGO versions to the abnormally-slow baseline
                    implementation.  So, the release and PGO timings were blended together into
                    a single CSV, and the Excel PivotTables pick whatever the minimum time is
                    for a given function and test input.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Thus, you're always looking at the PGO timings, except for this outlier case
                    where the release versions are faster.

                <p>

                    In this section, we'll take a look at the various implementations we
                    experimented with in order to get to the fastest version.

                </p>

                <h2>IsPrefixOfCStrInArray</h2>
                <p>

                    Let's review the baseline implementation again, as that's what we're ultimately
                    comparing ourselves against.  This version enumerates the string array (and thus
                    has a slightly different function signature to the STRING_TABLE-based functions)
                    looking for prefix matches.  No SIMD instructions are used.  The timings
                    captured should be proportional to the location of the test input string in the
                    array.  That is, it should take less time to prefix match strings that occur
                    earlier in the array versus those that appear later.

                <p>

                    This version is similar to the IsPrefixOfCStrInArray implementation, except it
                    utilizes the slot length information provided by the STRING_ARRAY structure, and
                    conforms to our standard IsPrefixOfStringInTable function signature.  It uses no
                    SIMD instructions.

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

    This routine performs a simple linear scan of the string table looking for
    a prefix match against each slot.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

                <h2>IsPrefixOfStringInTable_2</h2>

                <p>

                    This version is the first of the routines to use SIMD instructions.  It is
                    actually based on the prefix matching routine I wrote for the first version
                    of the StringTable component back in 2016.  The layout of the STRING_TABLE
                    struct differed in the first version; only the first character of each slot
                    was used to do the initial exclusion (as opposed to the unique character),
                    and lengths were unsigned shorts instead of chars (16 bits instead of 8 bits),
                    so the match bitmap had to be constructed slightly differently.

                </p>

                <p>

                    None of those details really apply to our second attempt at the StringTable
                    component, detailed in this article.  Our lengths are 8 bits, and we use unique
                    characters in the initial negative match fast-path.  However, the first version
                    used an elaborate AVX2 prefix match routine that was geared toward matching
                    long strings, depicted below:

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

    This is our first AVX-optimized version of the routine.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

                    Phew!  We finally see superior performance across the board.  This ends the
                    short lived tenure of the IsPrefixOfStringInTable_2 routine (which calls out to
                    the elaborate IsPrefixAvx2 routine), which is demonstrably worse in every case.
                    We'll also omit the IsPrefixOfCStrInArray routine from the graphs for now, as
                    it has served its initial baseline purpose.

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

    This routine is a variant of version 3 that uses a structured exception
    handler for loading the initial search string.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

    the assertion we've been making that it's more optimal to give the CPU
    to do a bunch of things up front versus doing something, then potentially
    branching, doing the next thing, potentially branching, etc.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

                    If our theory is correct, the performance of this version should be worse, due

                <p>

                    Version 6 is boring.  We tweak the initial loading of the search string,
                    explicitly loading it via an unaligned load.  If the underlying buffer is
                    aligned on a 16 byte boundary, this is just as fast as an aligned load.
                    If not, hey, at least it doesn't crash &mdash; it's just slow.

                </p>

                <p>

                    (If you attempt an aligned load on an address that isn't aligned at a 16 byte
                    boundary, the processor will generate an exception, resulting in the crash of
                    your program (assuming you don't have any structured exception handlers in place
                    to catch the error).)

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

    This routine differs from version 3 in that we do an unaligned load of
    the search string buffer without any SEH wrappers or alignment checks.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

    This routine is based off version 6, but alters when we calculate the
    "search length" for the given string, which is done via the expression
    'min(String-&gt;Length, 16)'.  We don't need this value until later in the
    routine, when we're ready to start comparing strings.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

    //  3. Load the string table's slot lengths array into an XMM register.

    //  4. Compare the unique character from step 1 to the string table's unique
    //     character array set up in step 2.  The result of this comparison

                    Tiny change, tiny performance improvement!  Looks like this saves a couple of
                    cycles, thus ending the short-lived rein of version 6.

                <p>

                    Version 8 is based off version 7, but omits the initial length test.  Again,
                    it's another small change, but if version 5 was anything to go off, the less
                    branches, the better.

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

    This routine is based off version 7, but omits the initial minimum
    length test of the string array.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

                    This is an interesting one.  The return versus goto looks to have cost us a
                    little bit with the first few test inputs.  But only a tiny amount, we're
                    talking about like 0.2 more cycles, which is nothing in the grand scheme of
                    things.  (Although let's not pull on that thread too much, the premise of the
                    whole article is at stake!)

                <p>
                    Version 9 improves the negative match performance by a few cycles, though, so
                    let's keep it.

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

    This version is based off version 9, but rewrites the inner loop that
    checks for comparisons.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

                    That's a nicer bit of logic.  More C-like, less assembly-like.  Arguably
                    clearer.  Let's see how they compare.  (This is an interesting one as I
                    genuinely don't have a strong hunch what sort of a performance impact this
                    will have; obviously I thought the first way of structuring the loop was
                    optimal, and I had that in place for two years before deciding to embark
                    on this article, which led to the rework we just saw.)

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

    This version is based off version 10, but with the vpandn used at the
    end of the initial test, as suggested by Wojciech Mula (@pshufb).

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

    //     other strings in the table) across a second Xmm register.

    //  2. Load the string table's unique character array into an Xmm register.
    //
    //  3. Broadcast the search string's length into an XMM register.
    //
    //  3. Load the string table's slot lengths array into an XMM register.
    //
    //  4. Compare the unique character from step 1 to the string table's unique
    //     character array set up in step 2.  The result of this comparison
    //     will produce an XMM register with each byte set to either 0xff if
    //     the unique character was found, or 0x0 if it wasn't.
    //
    //  5. Compare the search string's length from step 3 to the string table's

;     _In_ PSTRING_TABLE StringTable,

;     )
;
; Routine Description:
;
;   Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
;   search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
;   or is equal to" the search string.
;
;   This routine is based off version 2, but leverages the fact that
;   vptest sets the carry flag if '(xmm0 and (not xmm1))' evaluates
;   to all 0s, avoiding the the need to do the pxor or pandn steps.
;
; Arguments:
;
;   StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.
;
;   String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
;       search for.
;
;   Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
;       address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
;       additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.
;
; Return Value:
;
;   Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

    This version is based off version 10, but with factors in the improvements
    made to version 4 of the x64 assembly version, thanks to suggestions from
    both Wojciech Mula (@pshufb) and Fabian Giesen (@rygorous).

    Like version 11, we omit the vpxor to invert the lengths, but instead of
    an initial vpandn, we leverage the fact that vptest sets the carry flag
    if all 0s result from the expression: "param1 and (not param2)".  This
    allows us to do a fast-path early exit (like x64 version 2 does) if no
    match is found.

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

    //  3. Broadcast the search string's length into an XMM register.

    //  3. Load the string table's slot lengths array into an XMM register.
    //
    //  4. Compare the unique character from step 1 to the string table's unique
    //     character array set up in step 2.  The result of this comparison
    //     will produce an XMM register with each byte set to either 0xff if
    //     the unique character was found, or 0x0 if it wasn't.
    //
    //  5. Compare the search string's length from step 3 to the string table's

                    Another tidbit from Fabian: we can tweak the loop logic further and simply do a
                    'while (Bitmap) { }' loop instead of the 'do { } while (--Count)' approach.
                    This also simplifies the inner loop comparison logic, as we don't need to keep
                    shifting the bitmap by the trailing zero count to find the next set bit.

Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

    This version is based off version 10, but does away with the bitmap
    shifting logic and `do { } while (--Count)` loop, instead simply using

Arguments:

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

                <p>

                    If there's no match found, we check to see if we've performed the maximum number
                    of attempts, that is, whether or not we've exhausted all our string tables.  If
                    we have, we just default to the EnumType.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Otherwise, bump the StringTable pointer (which relies on the fact that the
                    underlying string table pointers in the session structure are contiguous &mdash;
                    a handy implementation detail), bump the match offset by number of entries per
                    string table, and try the match again.

                </p>

                <p>

                    If we found a match, we can obtain the SymbolType enum representation of the
                    underlying match by simply adding the match index to the match offset.  I like
                    that.  It's simple and fast.  It also plays nicely with switch statements; do
                    your lookup, resolve the underlying enum value, and process each possible path
                    in a case statement like you'd do with any other integer representation of an
                    option.

                </p>

                <p>

                    The other nice side-effect is that it forces you to pick which table a given
                    string should go in.  I made this decision by looking at which types occurred
                    most frequently, and simply put those in the first table.  Less frequent types
                    go in subsequent tables.

                </p>
                <p>

                    I have a hunch there's a lot of mileage in that approach; that is, linear
                    scanning an array of string tables until a match is found.  There will be an
                    inflection point where some form of a log(n) binary tree search will perform
                    better overall, but it would be very interesting to see how many strings you
                    need to potentially match against before that point is hit.

                </p>
                <p>

                    Unless the likelihood of matching any given string in your set is completely
                    random, by ordering the strings in your tables by how frequently they occur,
                    the amortized cost of parsing a chunk of text would be very competitive using
                    this approach, I would think.

                </p>
                <p>

                    A fun experiment for next time, perhaps!

                    Maybe put some notes here about the implications of authoring so many different

Routine Description:

    Loads the string table module and resolves all API functions for either
    the STRING_TABLE_API or STRING_TABLE_API_EX structure.  The desired API
    is indicated by the SizeOfAnyApi parameter.

    Example use:

        STRING_TABLE_API_EX GlobalApi;
        PSTRING_TABLE_API_EX Api;

        Success = LoadStringTableApi(Rtl,
                                     NULL,
                                     NULL,
                                     sizeof(GlobalApi),
                                     (PSTRING_TABLE_ANY_API)&amp;GlobalApi);
        ASSERT(Success);
        Api = &amp;GlobalApi;

    In this example, the extended API will be provided as our sizeof(GlobalApi)
    will indicate the structure size used by STRING_TABLE_API_EX.

    See ../StringTable2BenchmarkExe/main.c for a complete example.

Arguments:

    Rtl - Supplies a pointer to an initialized RTL structure.

    ModulePointer - Optionally supplies a pointer to an existing module handle
        for which the API symbols are to be resolved.  May be NULL.  If not
        NULL, but the pointed-to value is NULL, then this parameter will
        receive the handle obtained by LoadLibrary() as part of this call.
        If the string table module is no longer needed, but the program will
        keep running, the caller should issue a FreeLibrary() against this
        module handle.

    ModulePath - Optionally supplies a pointer to a UNICODE_STRING structure
        representing a path name of the string table module to be loaded.
        If *ModulePointer is not NULL, it takes precedence over this parameter.
        If NULL, and no module has been provided via *ModulePointer, an attempt
        will be made to load the library via 'LoadLibraryA("StringTable.dll")'.

    SizeOfAnyApi - Supplies the size, in bytes, of the underlying structure
        pointed to by the AnyApi parameter.

    AnyApi - Supplies the address of a structure which will receive resolved
        API function pointers.  The API furnished will depend on the size
        indicated by the SizeOfAnyApi parameter.

Return Value:

    TRUE on success, FALSE on failure.

Routine Description:

    Allocates space for a STRING_TABLE structure using the provided allocators,
    then initializes it using the provided STRING_ARRAY.  If CopyArray is set
    to TRUE, the routine will copy the string array such that the caller is
    free to destroy it after the table has been successfully created.  If it
    is set to FALSE and StringArray-&gt;StringTable has a non-NULL value, it is
    assumed that sufficient space has already been allocated for the string
    table and this pointer will be used to initialize the rest of the structure.

    DestroyStringTable() must be called against the returned PSTRING_TABLE when
    the structure is no longer needed in order to ensure resources are released.

Arguments:

    Rtl - Supplies a pointer to an initialized RTL structure.

    StringTableAllocator - Supplies a pointer to an ALLOCATOR structure which
        will be used for creating the STRING_TABLE.

    StringArrayAllocator - Supplies a pointer to an ALLOCATOR structure which
        may be used to create the STRING_ARRAY if it cannot fit within the
        padding of the STRING_TABLE structure.  This is kept separate from the
        StringTableAllocator due to the stringent alignment requirements of the
        string table.

    StringArray - Supplies a pointer to an initialized STRING_ARRAY structure
        that contains the STRING structures that are to be added to the table.

    CopyArray - Supplies a boolean value indicating whether or not the
        StringArray structure should be deep-copied during creation.  This is
        typically set when the caller wants to be able to free the structure
        as soon as this call returns (or can't guarantee it will persist past
        this function's invocation, i.e. if it was stack allocated).

Return Value:

    A pointer to a valid PSTRING_TABLE structure on success, NULL on failure.
    Call DestroyStringTable() on the returned structure when it is no longer
    needed in order to ensure resources are cleaned up appropriately.
