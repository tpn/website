    "section": "The Tracer Project",
    "text": "The Tracer Project\nOne of the frustrations I had with existing Python profilers was that there was no easy or efficient means to filter or exclude trace information based on the module name of the code being executed. I tackled this in my tracer project, which allows you to set an environment variable named TRACER_MODULE_NAMES to restrict which modules should be traced, e.g.:\nset TRACER_MODULE_NAMES=myproject1;myproject2;myproject3.subproject;numpy;pandas;scipy\nIf the code being executed is coming from the module myproject3.subproject.foo, then we need to trace it, as that string prefix matches the third entry on our list.\nThis article details the custom data structure and algorithm I came up with in order to try and solve the prefix matching problem more optimally with a SIMD approach. The resulting StringTable component is used extensively within the tracer project, and as such, must conform to unique constraints such as no use of the C runtime library and allocating all memory through TraceStore-backed allocators. Thus, it’s not really something you’d drop in to your current project in its current form. Hopefully, the article still proves to be interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code samples provided herein are copied directly from the tracer project, which is written in C and assembly, and uses the Pascal-esque Cutler Normal Form style for C. If you’re used to the more UNIX-style Kernel Normal Form of C, it’s quite like that, except that it’s absolutely nothing like that, and all these code samples will probably be very jarring."

    "text": "The Test Data\nInstead of using some arbitrary Python module names, this article is going to focus on a string table constructed out of a set of 16 strings that represent reserved names of the NTFS file system, at least when it was first released way back in the early 90s.\nThis list is desirable as it has good distribution of characters, there is a good mix of both short and long entries, plus one oversized one ($INDEX_ALLOCATION, which clocks in at 17 characters), and almost all strings lead with a common character (the dollar sign), preventing a simple first character optimization used by the initial version of the StringTable component I wrote in 2016.\nSo the scenario we’ll be emulating, in this case, is that we’ve just been passed a filename for creation, and we need to check if it prefix matches any of the reserved names.\nHere’s the full list of NTFS names we’ll be using. We’re assuming 8-bit ASCII encoding (no UTF-8) and case sensitive. (If this were actually the NT kernel, we’d need to use wide characters with UTF-16 encoding, and be case-insensitive.)\n\nNTFS Reserved Names\n\n$AttrDef\n$BadClus\n$Bitmap\n$Boot\n$Extend\n$LogFile\n$MftMirr\n$Mft\n$Secure\n$UpCase\n$Volume\n$Cairo\n$INDEX_ALLOCATION\n$DATA\n????\n.\n\nThe ordering is important in certain cases. For example, when you have overlapping strings, such as $MftMirr and $Mft, you should put the longest strings first. They will be matched first, and as our routine terminates upon the first successful prefix match—if a longer string resided after a shorter one, it would never get detected.\nLet’s review some guiding design requirements and cover some of the design decisions I made, which should help shape your understanding of the implementation."

The rationale behind this is that shorter strings simply have fewer characters to choose from, while longer strings have more to choose from. If we identified unique characters in the order they appear in the string table, we may have longer strings preceding shorter ones, such that toward the end of the table, nothing unique can be extracted from the short ones.\nThe utility of the string table is maximized by ensuring a unique character is selected from every string; thus, we sort by length first. Note that the uniqueness is actually determined by offset:character pairs, with the offsets becoming the indices stored in the UniqueIndex slot. If you trace through the diagram above, you’ll see that the unique character in each slot matches the character in the corresponding string slot, indicated by the underlying index."

There’s a neat deck called Engineering Better Software at Microsoft which captures some interesting details about SAL, for those wanting to read more. The Code Analysis engine that uses the annotations is built upon the Z3 Theorem Prover, which is a fascinating little project in its own right.\n\n\nAnd finally, we’re left with the smaller helper structs that we use to encapsulate the various innards of the string table. (I use unions that feature XMMWORD representations (which is a typedef of __m128i, representing an XMM register) as well as underlying byte/character representations, as I personally find it makes the resulting C code a bit nicer.)"

The PGO build is faster than the normal release build in every case except one, where it is notably slower.\nIt’s… odd. I haven’t investigated it. The following graph depicts the affected function, IsPrefixOfStringInTable_1, and a few other versions for reference, showing the performance of the PGO build compared to the release build on the input strings \"$INDEX_ALLOCATION\" and \"$Bai123456789012\".\n\n\n\nBenchmark Release vs PGO\n\n\nOnly that function is affected, and the problem mainly manifests with the two example test strings shown. As this routine essentially serves as one of the initial baseline implementations, it would be misleading to compare all optimized PGO versions to the abnormally slow baseline implementation. Therefore, the release and PGO timings were blended into a single CSV, and the Excel PivotTables select the minimum time for a given function and test input.\nThus, you’re always looking at the PGO timings, except for this outlier case where the release versions are faster."

I figured there were a couple of ways I could present this information. First, I could hand-pick what I choose to show and hide, creating a rosy picture that makes it seem like I effortlessly arrived at the fastest implementation without much actual effort whatsoever.\nOr I could show the gritty reality of how everything actually went down in chronological fashion, errors and all. And there were definitely some errors! For better or worse, I’ve chosen this route, so you’ll get to see some pretty tedious tweaks (changing a single line, for example) before the juicy stuff really kicks in.\nAdditionally, with the benefit of writing this section introduction retroactively, iterations 4 and 5 aren’t testing what I initially thought they were testing. I’ve left them in as is; if anything, it demonstrates the importance of only changing one thing at a time and making sure you’re testing what you think you’re testing.

Even without using any SIMD instructions, version 1, the IsPrefixOfStringInTable_1 routine, is faster (in all but one case) than the baseline IsPrefixOfCStrInArray routine, thanks to a more sophisticated data structure.\n(And really, it’s not even using the sophisticated parts of the STRING_TABLE; it’s just leveraging the fact that we’ve captured the lengths of each string in the backing STRING_ARRAY structure by virtue of using the STRING structure to wrap our strings (instead of relying on the standard NULL-terminated C string approach).)\n\nBefore we look at IsPrefixOfStringInTable_2, which is the first of the routines to use SIMD instructions, it’s helpfu to know some backstory. The _2 version is based on the prefix matching routine I wrote for the first version of the StringTable component back in 2016. The layout of the STRING_TABLE struct differed in the first version; only the first character of each slot was used to do the initial exclusion (as opposed to the unique character), and lengths were unsigned shorts instead of chars (16 bits instead of 8 bits), so the match bitmap had to be constructed slightly differently.\nNone of those details really apply to our second attempt at the StringTable component, detailed in this article. Our lengths are 8 bits, and we use unique characters in the initial negative match fast-path. However, the first version used an elaborate AVX2 prefix match routine geared toward matching long strings, attempting to use non-temporal streaming load instructions where possible (which would only make sense for a large number of long strings in specific cache-thrashing scenarios).\nCompare our simpler implementation, IsPrefixMatch, used from version 3 onward, to the far more elaborate (and unnecessary) IsPrefixMatchAvx2:\n\n\nIsPrefixMatch\nFORCEINLINE\nBYTE\nIsPrefixMatch(\n    _In_ PCSTRING SearchString,\n    _In_ PCSTRING TargetString,\n    _In_ BYTE Offset\n    )\n{\n    PBYTE Left;\n    PBYTE Right;\n    BYTE Matched = 0;\n    BYTE Remaining = (SearchString-&gt;Length - Offset) + 1;\n\n    Left = (PBYTE)RtlOffsetToPointer(SearchString-&gt;Buffer, Offset);\n    Right = (PBYTE)RtlOffsetToPointer(TargetString-&gt;Buffer, Offset);\n\n    while (--Remaining && *Left++ == *Right++) {\n        Matched++;\n    }\n\n    Matched += Offset;\n    if (Matched != TargetString-&gt;Length) {\n        return NO_MATCH_FOUND;\n    }\n\n    return Matched;\n}\n\n\nIsPrefixMatchAvx2\nThe AVX2 routine is overkill, especially considering the emphasis we put on favoring short strings over longer ones in the requirements section. However, we want to put broad statements like that to the test, so let’s include it as our first SIMD implementation to see how it stacks up against the simpler versions.\nFORCEINLINE\nUSHORT\nIsPrefixMatchAvx2(\n    _In_ PCSTRING SearchString,\n    _In_ PCSTRING TargetString,\n    _In_ USHORT Offset\n    )\n{\n    USHORT SearchStringRemaining;\n    USHORT TargetStringRemaining;\n    ULONGLONG SearchStringAlignment;\n    ULONGLONG TargetStringAlignment;\n    USHORT CharactersMatched = Offset;\n\n    LONG Count;\n    LONG Mask;\n\n    PCHAR SearchBuffer;\n    PCHAR TargetBuffer;\n\n    STRING_SLOT SearchSlot;\n\n    XMMWORD SearchXmm;\n    XMMWORD TargetXmm;\n    XMMWORD ResultXmm;\n\n    YMMWORD SearchYmm;\n    YMMWORD TargetYmm;\n    YMMWORD ResultYmm;\n\n    SearchStringRemaining = SearchString-&gt;Length - Offset;\n    TargetStringRemaining = TargetString-&gt;Length - Offset;\n\n    SearchBuffer = (PCHAR)RtlOffsetToPointer(SearchString-&gt;Buffer, Offset);\n    TargetBuffer = (PCHAR)RtlOffsetToPointer(TargetString-&gt;Buffer, Offset);\n\n    //\n    // This routine is only called in the final stage of a prefix match when\n    // we've already verified the slot's corresponding original string length\n    // (referred in this routine as the target string) is less than or equal\n    // to the length of the search string.\n    //\n    // We attempt as many 32-byte comparisons as we can, then as many 16-byte\n    // comparisons as we can, then a final &lt; 16-byte comparison if necessary.\n    //\n    // We use aligned loads if possible, falling back to unaligned if not.\n    //\n\nStartYmm:\n\n    if (SearchStringRemaining &gt;= 32 && TargetStringRemaining &gt;= 32) {\n\n        //\n        // We have at least 32 bytes to compare for each string.

Let’s see how they compare. (This is an interesting one, as I genuinely don’t have a strong hunch about what kind of performance impact this will have; obviously, I thought the initial way of structuring the loop was optimal, and I had it in place for two years before deciding to embark on this article, which led to the rework we just saw. )\n\n\nBenchmark 10\n\n\n\nBenchmark 10\n\n\nHey, look at that! We’ve shaved off a few more cycles in most cases, especially for the negative matches!\n\n\n\nSpeeding Up Negative Matches with Assembly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nIf you build the Tracer project, you can run a helper batch file in the root directory called cdb-simple.bat, which uses cdb to launch one of the project’s executables, ModuleLoader.exe. This will start up, load all of our tracing project’s DLLs, then allow the debugger to break in, yielding a debugger prompt from which we can easily disassemble functions, inspect runtime function entries, etc. This is the approach I used for capturing the output over the next couple of sections.\n\n\n\nNow for the fun part! Let’s take a look at the disassembly of the initial part of version 10 responsible for the negative match logic and see if there are any improvements we can make.\n0:000&gt; uf StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10\nStringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10:\n00007fff`f69c1df0 48896c2418      mov     qword ptr [rsp+18h],rbp\n00007fff`f69c1df5 4889742420      mov     qword ptr [rsp+20h],rsi\n00007fff`f69c1dfa 4155            push    r13\n00007fff`f69c1dfc 4156            push    r14\n00007fff`f69c1dfe 4157            push    r15\n00007fff`f69c1e00 4883ec20        sub     rsp,20h\n00007fff`f69c1e04 c5fa6f5920      vmovdqu xmm3,xmmword ptr [rcx+20h]\n00007fff`f69c1e09 4c8b6a08        mov     r13,qword ptr [rdx+8]\n00007fff`f69c1e0d 4d8bf0          mov     r14,r8\n00007fff`f69c1e10 440fb63a        movzx   r15d,byte ptr [rdx]\n00007fff`f69c1e14 33ed            xor     ebp,ebp\n00007fff`f69c1e16 44883c24        mov     byte ptr [rsp],r15b\n00007fff`f69c1e1a 488bf1          mov     rsi,rcx\n00007fff`f69c1e1d c4e279780c24    vpbroadcastb xmm1,byte ptr [rsp]\n00007fff`f69c1e23 c4c17a6f6500    vmovdqu xmm4,xmmword ptr [r13]\n00007fff`f69c1e29 c4e259004110    vpshufb xmm0,xmm4,xmmword ptr [rcx+10h]\n00007fff`f69c1e2f c5f97411        vpcmpeqb xmm2,xmm0,xmmword ptr [rcx]\n00007fff`f69c1e33 c5e164c9        vpcmpgtb xmm1,xmm3,xmm1\n00007fff`f69c1e37 c5f1ef0d41320000 vpxor   xmm1,xmm1,xmmword ptr [StringTable2!_xmmffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff (00007fff`f69c5080)]\n00007fff`f69c1e3f c5e9dbd1        vpand   xmm2,xmm2,xmm1\n00007fff`f69c1e43 c579d7c2        vpmovmskb r8d,xmm2\n00007fff`f69c1e47 c5fa7f5c2410    vmovdqu xmmword ptr [rsp+10h],xmm3\n00007fff`f69c1e4d 4585c0          test    r8d,r8d\n00007fff`f69c1e50 0f849a000000    je      StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10+0x100 (00007fff`f69c1ef0)\nThere’s a bit of cruft at the start regarding setting up the function’s prologue (pushing non-volatile registers to the stack, etc. ). That’s to be expected for C (and C++, and basically every language); as the programmer, you don’t have any direct control over how many registers a compiler uses for a routine, how much stack space it uses, which registers it uses when, etc.\nHowever, with assembly, we’re on the opposite end of the spectrum: we can control everything! We also have a little trick up our sleeves: the venerable LEAF_ENTRY.\n\nWindows x64 ABI Calling Conventions\nFirst, some background. The Windows x64 ABI and calling convention dictate two types of functions: NESTED_ENTRY and LEAF_ENTRY.\n\nNESTED_ENTRY\nNESTED_ENTRY is by far the most common; C and C++ functions are all implicitly NESTED_ENTRY functions. (The LEAF_ENTRY and NESTED_ENTRY symbols are MASM (ml64.exe) macro names, but the concept applies to all languages.)\n\n\nLEAF_ENTRY\nA LEAF_ENTRY can only be implemented in assembly. It is constrained in that it may not manipulate any of the non-volatile x64 registers (rbx, rdi, rsi, rsp, rbp, r12, r13, r14, r15, xmm6-15), nor may it call any other functions (since call implicitly modifies the stack pointer), nor may it have a structured exception handler (since handling an exception for a given stack frame also manipulates the stack pointer).\nThe reason for these constraints is that LEAF_ENTRY routines do not have any unwind information generated for them in their runtime function entries. Unwind information is used by the kernel to, well, unwind the modifications made to non-volatile registers while traversing back up through the call stack looking for an exception handler in the event of an exception.\nFor example, here’s the function entry and associated unwind information for the PGO build of the IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10 function:\n0:000&gt; .fnent StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10\nDebugger function entry 000001d8`2ea03cf8 for:\n(00007fff`f8411df0)   StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10\nExact matches:\n    StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10 (struct _STRING_TABLE *,\n                                             struct _STRING *,\n                                             struct _STRING_MATCH *)\n\nBeginAddress      = 00000000`00001df0\nEndAddress        = 00000000`00001e59\nUnwindInfoAddress = 00000000`000054f8\n\nUnwind info at 00007fff`f84154f8, 14 bytes\n  version 1, flags 0, prolog 14, codes 8\n  00: offs 14, unwind op 4, op info 6   UWOP_SAVE_NONVOL FrameOffset: 58 reg: rsi.\n  02: offs 14, unwind op 4, op info 5   UWOP_SAVE_NONVOL FrameOffset: 50 reg: rbp.\n  04: offs 14, unwind op 2, op info 3   UWOP_ALLOC_SMALL.\n  05: offs 10, unwind op 0, op info f   UWOP_PUSH_NONVOL reg: r15.\n  06: offs e, unwind op 0, op info e    UWOP_PUSH_NONVOL reg: r14.\n  07: offs c, unwind op 0, op info d    UWOP_PUSH_NONVOL reg: r13.\nWe can see that this routine manipulates six non-volatile registers in total, including the stack pointer. The first instructions of the routine constitute the function’s prologue; in the disassembly, you can see that three of the rxx registers are pushed to the stack, followed by the allocation of 0x20 (32) bytes of stack space:\n0:000&gt; uf StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10\nStringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10:\n00007fff`f69c1df0 48896c2418      mov     qword ptr [rsp+18h],rbp\n00007fff`f69c1df5 4889742420      mov     qword ptr [rsp+20h],rsi\n00007fff`f69c1dfa 4155            push    r13\n00007fff`f69c1dfc 4156            push    r14\n00007fff`f69c1dfe 4157            push    r15\n00007fff`f69c1e00 4883ec20        sub     rsp,20h\nIt also cheekily uses the home parameter space for stashing rbp and rsi instead of pushing them to the stack. That’s fair game, though—this is the PGO build, so I’d expect it to use some extra tricks to shave off a few cycles here and there. I’d do the same if I were writing assembly. (Side note: if you view the source of this page, there’s a commented-out section below that shows the runtime function entry for the release build of version 10; it uses nine registers instead of six and 40 bytes of stack space instead of 32. I wrote it before switching to using the PGO build for everything.)\nThe home parameter space is a 32-byte area that immediately follows the return address (i.e., the value of rsp when the function is entered); it is mandated by the x64 calling convention on Windows and is primarily intended to provide scratch space for a routine to home its parameter registers (i.e., the registers used for the first four arguments of a function: rcx, rdx, r8, and r9). This allows the four volatile registers to be repurposed within a routine while still providing a way to refer to the parameters if needed. That’s its intended use—however, it’s not strictly enforced, so you can essentially treat this area as a free 32-byte scratch space if you’re writing assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn a semi-related note, I’d highly recommend reading A History of Modern 64-bit Computing if you have some spare time. It’s a fascinating insight into contemporary x64 conventions we often take for granted, drawing on numerous interviews with industry luminaries like Dave Cutler and Linus Torvalds. I found it incredibly useful for understanding the why behind concepts like home parameter space, structured exception handling, runtime function entries, and why you can’t write inline assembly for x64 with MSVC anymore—apparently, it provides a direct vector for disrupting the mechanisms relied upon by the kernel stack unwinding functionality. (At least, I think that’s the reason—can anyone from Microsoft confirm?))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Implementations\n\nIsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_1\nIsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_2 →\nSo, knowing what we now know about the venerable little LEAF_ENTRY trick, let’s see if we can construct a simple routine in assembly that just deals with the negative match case.\n;++\n;\n; STRING_TABLE_INDEX\n; IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_*(\n;     _In_ PSTRING_TABLE StringTable,\n;     _In_ PSTRING String,\n;     _Out_opt_ PSTRING_MATCH Match\n;     )\n;\n; Routine Description:\n;\n;   Searches a string table to see if any strings \"prefix match\" the given\n;   search string.

If an exception occurs within the body of our implementation (say we dereference a NULL pointer), the kernel knows it doesn’t have to undo any non-volatile register modifications (using offsets specified by the unwind information) because there isn’t any unwind information. It can simply advance to the frame before us (e. g. , rsp at the time of the fault, minus 8 bytes) as it continues its search for runtime function entries and associated unwind information. As you can see, the unwind info is effectively empty:\n0:000&gt; .fnent StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_1\nDebugger function entry 000001f9`048edf98 for:\nExact matches:\n    StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_1 (void)\n\nBeginAddress      = 00000000`00003290\nEndAddress        = 00000000`000032cb\nUnwindInfoAddress = 00000000`00004468\n\nUnwind info at 00007ffd`15594468, 4 bytes\n  version 1, flags 0, prolog 0, codes 0\n\n\nBenchmark x64 1\nLet’s see how this scrappy little fellow (who always returns NO_MATCH_FOUND but still mimics the steps required to successfully negative match) does against the leading C implementation at this point, version 10:\n\n\n\nBenchmark x64 1\n\n\nFwoah, look at that, we’ve shaved about three cycles off the C version!\n (Note that when I first wrote this, I was comparing the assembly version against the release build (not the PGO build), which was clocking in at about 13-14 cycles for negative matching. So getting it down to ~7.5 from 13-14 was a bit more exciting. Damn the PGO build and its 10.9-ish cycles for negative matching!) \nThe good news is that our theory about the performance of the LEAF_ENTRY looks like it’s paid off: we can reliably get about 7.5 cycles for negative matching.\n\n\nIsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_2\n← IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_1 | IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_3 →\nThe bad news is that we now need to implement the rest of the functionality within the constraints of a LEAF_ENTRY!\nThe problem with a LEAF_ENTRY for anything more than a trivial bit of code is that you only have a handful of volatile registers to work with, and no stack space can be used for register spilling or temporaries. (Technically I could use the home parameter space, but, eh, we’re already avoiding stack spills, why not make life harder for ourselves and try to avoid all memory spilling.)\nIf you can’t spill to memory, your only option is really spilling to XMM registers via vpinsr and vpextr combinations, which, as you can see in the implementation of version 2 below, I have to do a lot.\n (Also note: when I wrote this version, I didn’t use the disassembly from the C routines for guidance. I find that as soon as you start to grok the disassembly for a given routine, it becomes harder to think of ways to approach it from a fresh angle. Also, the LEAF_ENTRY aspect significantly limited what I could do anyway, so I figured I may as well just give it a crack from scratch and see what I could come up with. It would be an interesting point of reference compared to a future iteration that tries to improve on the disassembly of an optimized PGO version, for example.) \nThe diff view for this routine is less useful given the vast majority of the code is new, so I’ve put the full version of the code first. It’s based more or less on the approach used by version 8 of the C routine (I actually wrote it after I wrote version 8; versions 9 and 10 of the C routine (with the latter having the improved loop logic) came after).\n\nFullDiff\n\n\n;++\n;\n; STRING_TABLE_INDEX\n; IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_*(\n;     _In_ PSTRING_TABLE StringTable,\n;     _In_ PSTRING String,\n;     _Out_opt_ PSTRING_MATCH Match\n;     )\n;\n; Routine Description:\n;\n;   Searches a string table to see if any strings \"prefix match\" the given\n;   search string.

Writing assembly is slow; writing correct assembly is even slower. I generally find that there’s a noticeable hump I need to get over in the first, say, 30 minutes of any assembly programming session, but once you get into the zone, things can start flowing quite nicely. I’m an aggressive debugger user; often, to get started, I’ll write a simple LEAF_ENTRY that looks like this:\n    LEAF_ENTRY Foo, _TEXT$00\n        int 3\n        xor eax, eax\n        ret\n    LEAF_END Foo, _TEXT$00\nThat’ll allow me to attach the debugger and at least inspect the parameter registers so I can write the next couple of instructions. I find it definitely helps get me into the zone quicker.\nAnyway, enough about that. Let’s look at performance. Again, this will be an interesting one—other than the optimal negative match logic that I copied from version 1, the sole focus was on getting a working assembly version; I wasn’t giving any thought to performance at this stage.\nSo, it’ll be interesting to see how it compares to a) version 1 in the negative matching case (it should be very close), and b) against the C versions in the prefix matching case (it hopefully won’t be prohibitively worse).\n\n\nBenchmark x64 2: Negative Matching\n\n\n\nBenchmark Negative Match\n\n\nHmmm, that’s not too bad! We’re very close to version 1 for negative matching, within about 0.5 cycles or so. That sounds about right, given that our initial logic had to be tweaked a bit to play nicer with the rest of the implementation. And we’re still about 3-4 cycles faster than the fastest C version.\nWhat about prefix matching performance?\n\n\nBenchmark x64 2: Prefix Matching\n\n\n\nBenchmark Prefix Match\n\n\nThe prefix matching performance isn’t too bad either! We’re definitely slower than the C version, ranging from about 4 cycles to 10 cycles in most cases, with the $INDEX_ALLOCATION input about 13 cycles slower.\n  (I’ve just noticed the pattern with regards to the first 8 entries, $AttrDef to $Mft, clocking in at about 18 and 24 cycles respectively. But the next four entries, $Secure to $Cairo, consistently clock in at about 24 and 34 cycles respectively. $Secure is the 9th slot, which puts it at memory offset 192 bytes from the start of the string table. And then the 18 and 24 cycle behavior returns for the last two items, ???? and ., which are at the end of the string table’s inner slot array. This pattern is prevalent in all of our iterations. Very peculiar! We’ll investigate later.) \n\n\nIsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_3\n← IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_2 | IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_4 →\n(We’re nearly at the end of the first round of iterations, I promise!)\nSeeing the performance of the second version in assembly, I decided to try whipping up a third version, which would switch from a LEAF_ENTRY to NESTED_ENTRY and use rep cmps for the byte comparison for long strings (instead of the byte-by-byte approach used now).\nIn order to use rep cmps, you need to use two non-volatile registers, rsi (the source index) and rdi (the destination index). You also need to specify the direction of the comparison, which means mutating the flags, which are also classed as non-volatile, so they need to be pushed to the stack in the prologue and popped back off in the epilogue.\nI didn’t really expect this to offer a measurable speedup, but it was a tangible reason to use a NESTED_ENTRY, and otherwise allowed me to stay within the confines of the version 2 implementation.\nLet’s take a look at the implementation. At the very least, it’s useful to see how you can go about organizing your prologue in MASM. For NESTED_ENTRY routines, I always define a Locals structure that incorporates the return address and home parameter space for easy access. Mainly because it allows me to write code like this:\n    mov     Locals.HomeRcx[rsp], rcx        ; Home our first param.\n    mov     Locals.HomeRdx[rsp], rdx        ; Home our second param.\n    mov     rsi, Locals.SavedRsi[rsp]       ; Restore rsi.\n    mov     rdi, Locals.SavedRdi[rsp]       ; Restore rdi.\nInstead of working wiht offsets like this:\n    mov     qword ptr [rsp+30h], rcx        ; Home our first param.\n    mov     qword ptr [rsp+38h], rdx        ; Home our second param.\n    mov     rsi, qword ptr [rsp+10h]        ; Restore rsi.\n    mov     rdi, qword ptr [rsp+8]          ; Restore rdi.\nThis routine was written last, after version 10 of the C routine, so it incorporates the slightly re-arranged loop logic that proved to be faster for that version.

Even its negative matching performance is terrible, which is the one thing the assembly versions have been good at so far. How peculiar.\nNow, in the interest of keeping events chronological, as much as I’d like to dive in now and figure out why, I’ll have to defer to my behavior when I encountered this performance gap: I laughed, shelved the version 3 experiment, and moved on.\nThat’s a decidedly unsatisfying end to the matter, though, I’ll admit. We’ll come back to it later in the article and try and get some closure as to why it was so slow, comparatively.\n\n\n\nInternet Feedback\nSo, at this point, with version 10 of the C routine and version 2 of the assembly version in hand, and a very early draft of this article, I solicited feedback on Twitter and got some great responses. Thanks again to Fabian Giesen, Wojciech Muła, Geoff Langdale, Daniel Lemire, and Kendall Willets for their discussion and input over the course of a few days!"

The _mm_testc_si128() alteration was a tiny bit slower for version 12 across the board. However, the vptest (which is the underlying assembly instruction that maps to the _mm_testc_si128() intrinsic) version 4 of our assembly was definitely a little bit faster than the other versions. Let’s see how our final C version performs.\n\n\nBenchmark 14\n\n\n\nBenchmark 14\n\n\nWelp, at least it’s consistent! Like version 12, the _mm_testc_si128() change doesn’t really offer a compelling improvement for version 14. That makes version 13 officially our fastest C implementation for round 2.\n\n\nIsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_5\n← IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_4 | IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_6 →\nBefore we conclude round 2, let’s see if we can eke any more performance out of the negative match fast path of our fastest assembly version so far: version 4. For this step, I’m going to leverage Intel Architecture Code Analyzer, or IACA, for short.\nThis is a handy little static analysis tool that can provide useful information for fine-tuning performance-sensitive code. Let’s take a look at the output from IACA for our assembly version 4. To do this, I uncomment the two macros, IACA_VC_START and IACA_VC_END, which reside at the start and end of the negative match logic. These macros are defined in StringTable.inc, and look like this:\nIACA_VC_START macro Name\n\n        mov     byte ptr gs:[06fh], 06fh\n\n        endm\n\nIACA_VC_END macro Name\n\n        mov     byte ptr gs:[0deh], 0deh\n\n        endm\nThe equivalent versions for C are defined in Rtl.h, and look like this:\n//\n// Define start/end markers for IACA.\n//\n\n#define IACA_VC_START() __writegsbyte(111, 111)\n#define IACA_VC_END()   __writegsbyte(222, 222)\nYou may have noticed commented-out versions of these macros in both the C and assembly code. What they do is emit a specific byte pattern in the instruction byte code that the IACA tool can detect. You place the start and end markers around the code you’re interested in, recompile it, then run IACA against the final executable (or library).\nLet’s see what happens when we do this for our version 4 assembly routine. I’ll include the relevant assembly snippet, reformatted into a more concise fashion, followed by the IACA output (also reformatted into a more concise fashion):\n\nAssemblyIACA\n\n\nmov      rax,  String.Buffer[rdx]                       ; Load address of string buffer.\nvmovdqu  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rax]                        ; Load search buffer.\nvmovdqa  xmm1, xmmword ptr StringTable.UniqueIndex[rcx] ; Load indexes.\nvpshufb  xmm5, xmm0, xmm1                               ; Rearrange string by uniq. ix.\nvmovdqa  xmm2, xmmword ptr StringTable.UniqueChars[rcx] ; Load unique chars.\nvpcmpeqb xmm5, xmm5, xmm2                               ; Compare unique chars.\nvmovdqa  xmm3, xmmword ptr StringTable.Lengths[rcx]     ; Load table lengths.\nvpbroadcastb xmm4, byte ptr String.Length[rdx]          ; Broadcast string length.\nvpcmpgtb xmm1, xmm3, xmm4                               ; Identify long slots.\nvptest   xmm1, xmm5                                     ; Unique slots AND (!long slots).\njnc      short Pfx10                                    ; CY=0, continue with routine.\nxor      eax, eax                                       ; CY=1, no match.

What I’m really looking at in this pass is what my block throughput is, and potentially what the bottleneck is.\nIn this case, our block throughput is being reported as 3.74 cycles, which basically indicates how many CPU cycles it takes to execute the block. Our bottleneck is dependency chains, which refers to the situation where, say, instruction C can’t start because the results from instruction A aren’t ready yet.\nAlright, well, what can we do? A good answer would be that with an intimate understanding of contemporary Intel CPU architecture, you can pinpoint exactly what needs changing in order to reduce dependencies, maximize port utilization, and generally make the CPU happier.\nOr you can just move shit around until the number gets smaller. That’s what I did.\nWell, that’s not entirely true. Fabian did make a good suggestion when he was reviewing some of my assembly that I was often needlessly doing a load into an XMM register only to use it once in a subsequent operation. Instead of doing that, I could just use the load-op version of the instruction, which allows for an instruction input parameter to be sourced from memory.\nFor example, instead of this:\nvmovdqa  xmm2, xmmword ptr StringTable.UniqueChars[rcx] ; Load unique chars.\nvpcmpeqb xmm5, xmm5, xmm2                               ; Compare unique chars.\nYou can just do this:\nvpcmpeqb xmm5, xmm5, xmmword ptr StringTable.UniqueChars[rcx] ; Compare...\nBut yeah, other than a few load-op tweaks, I basically just shuffled shit around until the block throughput reported lower. Very rigorous methodology, I know. Here’s the final version, which also happens to be the version quoted in the introduction of this article:\n\nAssemblyIACA\n\n\nmov      rax,  String.Buffer[rdx]                   ; Load address of string buffer.\nvpbroadcastb xmm4, byte ptr String.Length[rdx]      ; Broadcast string length.\nvmovdqa  xmm3, xmmword ptr StringTable.Lengths[rcx] ; Load table lengths.\nvmovdqu  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rax]                    ; Load string buffer.\nvpcmpgtb xmm1, xmm3, xmm4                           ; Identify slots &gt; string len.\nvpshufb  xmm5, xmm0, StringTable.UniqueIndex[rcx]   ; Rearrange string by unique index.\nvpcmpeqb xmm5, xmm5, StringTable.UniqueChars[rcx]   ; Compare rearranged to unique.\nvptest   xmm1, xmm5                                 ; Unique slots AND (!long slots).\njnc      short Pfx10                                ; CY=0, continue with routine.\nxor      eax, eax                                   ; CY=1, no match.\nnot      al                                         ; al = -1 (NO_MATCH_FOUND).\nret                                                 ; Return NO_MATCH_FOUND.\n\n\nS:\\Source\\tracer&gt;iaca x64\\Release\\StringTable2.dll\nIntel(R) Architecture Code Analyzer\nVersion -  v3.0-28-g1ba2cbb build date: 2017-10-23;17:30:24\nAnalyzed File -  x64\\Release\\StringTable2.dll\nBinary Format - 64Bit\nArchitecture  -  SKL\nAnalysis Type - Throughput\n\nThroughput Analysis Report\n--------------------------\nBlock Throughput: 3.48 Cycles       Throughput Bottleneck: FrontEnd\nLoop Count:  24\nPort Binding In Cycles Per Iteration:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Port   |  0  - DV  |  1  |  2  - D   |  3  - D   |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Cycles | 2.0   0.0 | 1.0 | 3.5   3.5 | 3.5   3.5 | 0.0 | 3.0 | 2.0 | 0.0 |\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDV - Divider pipe (on port 0)\nD - Data fetch pipe (on ports 2 and 3)\n* - instruction micro-ops not bound to a port\n^ - Micro Fusion occurred\n\n|    | Ports pressure in cycles        | |\n|µops|0DV| 1 | 2 - D | 3 - D |4| 5 | 6 |7|\n-------------------------------------------\n| 1  |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |   |   | | mov rax, qword ptr [rdx+0x8]\n| 2  |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |1.0|   | | vpbroadcastb xmm4, byte ptr [rdx]\n| 1  |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |   |   | | vmovdqa xmm3, xmmword ptr [rcx+0x20]\n| 1  |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |   |   | | vmovdqu xmm0, xmmword ptr [rax]\n| 1  |1.0|   |       |       | |   |   | | vpcmpgtb xmm1, xmm3, xmm4\n| 2^ |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |1.0|   | | vpshufb xmm5, xmm0, xmmword ptr [rcx+0x10]\n| 2^ |   |1.0|0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |   |   | | vpcmpeqb xmm5, xmm5, xmmword ptr [rcx]\n| 2  |1.0|   |       |       | |1.0|   | | vptest xmm1, xmm5\n| 1  |   |   |       |       | |   |1.0| | jnb 0x10\n| 1* |   |   |       |       | |   |   | | xor eax, eax\n| 1  |   |   |       |       | |   |1.0| | not al\n| 3^ |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |   |   | | ret\nTotal Num Of µops: 18\n\n\n\nAs you can see, that is reporting a block throughput of 3.48 instead of 3.74. A whopping 0.26 reduction! Also note the bottleneck is now being reported as FrontEnd, which basically means that the thing holding up this code now is literally the CPU’s ability to decode the actual instruction stream into actionable internal work.

    "text": "Implementation Considerations\nOne issue with writing so many versions of the exact same function is… how do you actually handle this? Downstream consumers of the component don’t need to access the 30 different function pointers for each function you’ve experimented with, but things like unit tests and benchmark programs do.\nHere’s what I did for the StringTable component. Define two API structures, a normal one and an “extended” one. The extended one mirrors the normal one, and then adds all of its additional functions to the end.\nI use a .def file to control the DLL function exports, with an alias to easily control which version of a function is the official version. The main header file then contains some bootstrap glue (in the form of an inline function) that dynamically loads the target library and resolves the number of API methods according to the size of the API structure provided.\nThis currently means that the StringTable2.dll includes all 14 C and 5 assembly variants, which is harmless, but it does increase the size of the module unnecessarily. (The module is currently about 19KB in size, whereas it would be under 4KB if only the official versions were included.) What I’ll probably end up doing is setting up a second project called StringTableEx, and, in conjunction with some #ifdefs, have that be the version of the module that contains all the additional functions, with the normal version just containing the official versions.\nHere’s the bootstrap glue from StringTable.h and the StringTable.def file I currently use.

I had to inject a &lt;rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" fill=\"#ffffff\" /&gt; into the start of each SVG file when porting to Quarto/Markdown in order to support dark mode. This set a white background for the diagram, which was otherwise transparent and did not render correctly in dark mode.\n\n\nBenchmarks\nAll of the resources used to generate this article, including raw .csv data, supporting .svgs, etc., live in the resources directory.\nThe charts were created in Excel. Each .csv data file was added as a new data source and imported, and then a PivotTable was created to generate the desired bar graph. This was then saved as PDF, which I then edited with Inkscape, deleting the surrounding border, cropping the canvas to fit the diagram, and then saving as SVG.\nAfter saving as SVG, I then edited each chart in Vim and manually did some font corrections. Looking at my .vimrc file, I believe this was what I used:\n\"\n\" SVG helpers.\n\"\n\nmap &lt;leader&gt;v\n    \\ &lt;ESC&gt;:% s/GillSans;/Calibri,GillSans-Light;/ge&lt;CR&gt;\n    \\ &lt;ESC&gt;:% s/Monaco/Monaco,Consolas,Menlo,monospace/ge&lt;CR&gt;\nI can’t remember if I did any other modifications whilst in Vim (I’m writing this colophon in 2024, but the SVG hacking was done over six years ago)."
