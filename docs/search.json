    "text": "Greg Stein’s Free Threaded Patch (1996)\nThe first attempt to remove the GIL was by Greg Stein in 1996, with a patch against Python 1.4.\nThe slowdown to single-threaded code as a result of this patch was prohibitively brutal, and the patch was never accepted. Fast-forward 15 years or so, and David Beazley wrote a detailed post in August 2011 about Greg Stein’s work in an article titled: An Inside Look at the GIL Removal Path of Lore. As part of this article, Dave obtains the original Python 1.4 source, applies Greg Stein’s patches, and takes the resulting free-threaded Python for a run. Dave confirms that, indeed, the slowdown introduced by this approach—where every increment and decrement reference results in either an interlocked op or a mutex lock and unlock—is prohibitively expensive.\nIn writing this article, I reviewed Dave’s article again, and attempted to download Python 1.4 so that I could apply Greg’s patches as well. Unfortunately, the download link Dave cites now 404s, so I googled “download Python 1.4 source”, and, funnily enough, the first hit is a Github repo titled tpn/python-1.4 that, ’lo and behold, is a repo I put together twelve years ago doing exactly that:\n\nImporting the original Python 1.4 source\nApplying Greg’s patches\n\n\nPython 1.4\n\nObjects and VarObjects\nPython’s main object structure, the PyObject, hasn’t changed much over the years. For non-container objects (i.e. scalars such as integers, floats, etc.) the structure is simply a reference count and a pointer to a type object:\ntypedef struct {\n    int ob_refcnt;\n    PyTypeObject *ob_type;\n} PyObject;\nContainer objects–otherwise known as “variable” objects–are represented via the PyVarObject structure. These structures “inherit” the base PyObject layout, and then add an additional field for tracking the number of elements contained by the object: the ob_size field. In Python 1.4, the structure looked like this:\ntypedef struct {\n    int ob_refcnt;\n    PyTypeObject *ob_type;\n    int ob_size;\n} PyVarObject;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe actual C header code for defining these structures is more baroque; the relevant Python 1.4 Include/object.h code looks like this:\n#define PyObject_HEAD \\\n    int ob_refcnt; \\\n    struct _typeobject *ob_type;\n#define PyObject_HEAD_INIT(type) 1, type,\n\n#define PyObject_VAR_HEAD \\\n    PyObject_HEAD \\\n    int ob_size; /* Number of items in variable part */\ntypedef struct _object {\n    PyObject_HEAD\n} PyObject;\n\ntypedef struct {\n    PyObject_VAR_HEAD\n} varobject;\n\n\n\n\nReference Counting\nThere was no cyclic garbage collection in Python 1.4–that feature wasn’t added until Python 2.0 around the October 2000 timeframe. Reference counting was the only means for Python to reclaim the memory used by objects that were no longer needed. The reference count was stored in the ob_refcnt field. Incrementing the reference simply added one to the existing value. Decrementing the reference subtracted one and checked to see if the resulting value was zero, and, if it was, the object would be deallocated via _Py_Dealloc().\nThe relevant Python 1.4 Include/object.h code used two macros named Py_INCREF() and Py_DECREF(), which looked like this:\n#define Py_INCREF(op) ((op)-&gt;ob_refcnt++)\n#define Py_DECREF(op)           \\\n    if (--(op)-&gt;ob_refcnt != 0) \\\n        ;                       \\\n    else                        \\\n        _Py_Dealloc(op)\nThese operations are inherently unsafe in a multi-threaded environment. If two or more separate threads are incrementing or decrementing reference counts to the same object in parallel, the results are effectively undefined, as there is no guarantee as to the correctness of the underlying value.\nThe solution for protecting against this was the Global Interpreter Lock, which ensured that only one thread could be running Python code at any given time.\nThus, if you’re embarking on an attempt to avoid this restriction, such that you can have multiple Python threads executing Python code simultaneously (i.e. on multi-core systems), the first thing you need to do is figure out how you’re going to handle making reference counting thread-safe.\n\n\n\nGreg’s Free-Threaded Approach\nGreg’s approach tried the most logical solution: make reference counting a thread-safe operation. He did this by using interlocked increment and decrement operations against the ob_refcnt field on NT (Windows) systems. On Linux, a mutex lock was used to protect the reference count.\nUsing a WITH_FREE_THREAD macro to gate his changes, Greg modified the reference counting logic to Include/object.h as follows:\n#ifdef WITH_FREE_THREAD\n#define Py_INCREF(op) Py_SafeIncr(&(op)-&gt;ob_refcnt)\n#define Py_DECREF(op)                       \\\n    if (Py_SafeDecr(&(op)-&gt;ob_refcnt) != 0) \\\n        ;                                   \\\n    else                                    \\\n        _Py_Dealloc(op)\n#else /* !WITH_FREE_THREAD */\n#define Py_INCREF(op) ((op)-&gt;ob_refcnt++)\n#define Py_DECREF(op)           \\\n    if (--(op)-&gt;ob_refcnt != 0) \\\n        ;                       \\\n    else                        \\\n        _Py_Dealloc(op)\n#endif /* !WITH_FREE_THREAD */\nSo, Py_INCREF(op) became a call to Py_SafeIncr(), and Py_DECREF(op) became a call to Py_SafeDecr(). On Windows, these routines were simply wrappers around the InterlockedIncrement and InterlockedDecrement intrinsics, respectively, defined here:\n#define Py_SafeIncr(pint)   InterlockedIncrement((long *)(pint))\n#define Py_SafeDecr(pint)   InterlockedDecrement((long *)(pint))\nOn non-NT systems, the Py_SafeIncr() and Py_SafeDecr() routines were aliased to _Py_SafeIncr() and _Py_SafeDecr(), respectively, which were implemented in Python/pymutex.c as follows:\n/* mutexes for the subsystems */\nPyMutex * _Py_RefMutex;\nPyMutex * _Py_ListMutex;\nPyMutex * _Py_MappingMutex;\nPyMutex * _Py_CritMutex;\n\n...\n\nint _Py_SafeIncr(pint)\n    int *pint;\n{\n    int result;\n    PyMutex_Lock(_Py_RefMutex);\n    result = ++*pint;\n    PyMutex_Unlock(_Py_RefMutex);\n    return result;\n}\n\nint _Py_SafeDecr(pint)\n    int *pint;\n{\n    int result;\n    PyMutex_Lock(_Py_RefMutex);\n    result = --*pint;\n    PyMutex_Unlock(_Py_RefMutex);\n    return result;\n}\nOof! That’s a single global mutex _Py_RefMutex protecting all reference counts for all objects. (N.B. PyMutex was a slim wrapper around pthread_mutex_t, and the lock and unlock operations simply called out to pthread_mutex_lock() and pthread_mutex_unlock() respectively.)\nCompared to simply incrementing a value in memory by one, obtaining a mutex lock and then unlocking the mutex is orders of magnitude more expensive, so it’s not surprising that this approach to removing the GIL introduced brutal slowdowns—not just to new multi-threaded code, but to existing single-threaded code that wasn’t even taking advantage of the fact that there was now no GIL in place.\nI hadn’t even heard of Python back in 1996—I was only in tenth grade at the time, and I don’t think I even knew what Windows NT was at that point, let alone Linux or FreeBSD. Nor did I have any aspirations to be a software engineer—I was gung-ho on becoming an F/A-18 Hornet fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).\nGetting back on track: Greg’s work tackled a lot of other important concepts like separating global state into per-thread state (something that is still relied upon today), as well as injecting pooled mutexes into builtin container types like list and dict objects.\nHowever, the performance impact to single-threaded code was deemed too great, and as such, Greg’s work never made it into mainline Python."

    "title": "DRAFT: From PyParallel to Python Free-Threading",
    "section": "PyParallel",
    "text": "PyParallel\nIn October 2012, there was a discussion on the python-ideas@ mailing list titled asyncore: included batteries don’t fit. The general discussion centered around providing better asynchronous I/O primitives in Python 3.4, and eventually led to the async and yield from keywords being introduced in Python 3.5, released around two years later in September 2015.\nThat thread was also the genesis for PyParallel; a fork of Python 3.3.5 that I created to implement a proof-of-concept version of the Python interpreter that tackled not only asynchronous I/O but also multi-core parallelism.\nThere’s a comprehensive backstory section on PyParallel at the end of this article that goes into more detail. For now, I just want to focus on the implementation details of PyParallel compared to Greg Stein’s earlier work, before discussing the free-threading implementation we now have today in Python 3.13t.\nI remember reading David Beazley’s article and a couple of YouTube videos he’d also done on the topic of the GIL. I made sure to review Greg’s approach to see what didn’t work in the past. Clearly, introducing fine-grained per-object synchronization for reference counts was prohibitively expensive—the interlocked increment and decrement operations alone were bad enough; the global pthread_mutex_t reference count approach never stood a chance.\nSo, what else could we try? My hunch was that there was a way to achieve parallelism within the Python interpreter when framed through the lens of asynchronous I/O primitives, such as a TCP/IP socket server. For example, why couldn’t a simple HTTP server be written in such a way that multiple threads could respond to incoming client requests on multiple cores simultaneously?\nIf you think about the type of server-side computation that is required to process an incoming HTTP request, it’s just pretty vanilla Python code. Sure, you may create a lot of temporary Python objects in servicing the request, but they’re only short-lived. Once you send a response back to the client, you don’t need any of those objects anymore. And you’re generally not mutating global state, so you don’t need any thread synchronization primitives during request processing. The underlying operating system’s kernel is handling all of that for you behind the scenes (i.e. you can safely accept() on multiple threads against the same sockaddr_in on Linux, or AcceptEx() against a single completion port on Windows).\nSo, as it pertained to reference counting, garbage collection, and memory allocation and deallocation—all thread-sensitive things that need to be handled very carefully in a GIL-less Python—with PyParallel, I explored the notion of: what if we just didn’t do any of that in parallel thread contexts?\nInstead of trying to remove the GIL, let’s keep the GIL, and instead, introduce a new concept of a parallel thread. Because if we can come up with an efficient way to determine if we’re a parallel thread at any given time, we can instrument all the thread-sensitive calls like Py_INCREF() and Py_DECREF() such that:\n\nIf we’re not a parallel thread (i.e. we’re holding the GIL), just do what we normally do.\nIf we are a parallel thread, do something else.\n\nThat’s the crux of PyParallel’s approach to achieving simultaneous multi-threading: instrument everything thread sensitive to detect if we’re a parallel thread, and do something else if we are.\nFor reference counting, the do something else was literally: do nothing.\nAgain, I was keen on targetting the very narrow domain of an asynchronous I/O based TCP/IP socket server, like a HTTP server, where none of the objects that are created as part of servicing the request need to persist once we’ve sent bytes back on the wire to the client.\nSo who cares about reference counts? We know when the parallel context starts and ends: it starts when we call the user’s data_received() routine, and it ends when that routine returns bytes which we then send back to the client.\nEach parallel thread can have a thread-local, simple block allocator, that is responsible for furnishing all memory allocation requests thanks to us having instrumented calls like PyObject_New and PyMem_Malloc. Block allocators are about the simplest memory allocator you can have: you have a pre-allocated block of memory (say, 4KB, or one page), a request comes in for 120 bytes, you capture the address of the current block pointer, increment it by 120 bytes, then return the captured address.\nHow do you free memory? Easy! You don’t! Again, socket-server callbacks are pretty short-lived; you’re not allocating gobs of memory that has an ambiguous lifetime. You’re doing lots of little allocations with very clear lifetimes: the allocations will cease to exist once the callback returns.\nHow do you handle garbage collection? Easy! You don’t! As you’re not mutating global state, any cyclic references you construct during the parallel thread callback will be magically taken care of when the callback completes, by virtue of the fact you’re simply resetting the block allocator back to the start of the first block. By not relying on reference counts to hit zero to trigger deallocation, you don’t need to worry about reference cycles.\nLarry Hasting’s Gilectomy.\nThe hilarious Reddit post by user /u/corysama in the thread Describe what developing for each console you’ve developed for is like.. With regards to PS2 development, the following comment always stood out to me:\n\nThere are so many amazing things you can do, but everything requires backflips through invisible blades of segfault.\n\nThat absolutely encompasses the first few months of developing PyParallel. And then all subsequent months. Larry Hasting’s has a similar sentiment in the Gilectomy README, with the first sentence proudly stating:\n\nWelcome to the exciting world of segfaults and massive slowdowns!\n\n…"

    "section": "PyParallel Backstory",
    "text": "PyParallel Backstory\nI’m not sure how interesting this section will be to readers, which is why I’ve stashed it at the end of the article. The older I get—especially now that I have a daughter—the more cathartic it is reminiscing about the early parts of my career some nearly-two-decades-ago.\nThis section captures the backstory behind PyParallel. PyParallel was born out of a) my interest in asynchronous I/O and multithreaded programming, and b) my experience with Snakebite, an “open source network” I built with the goal to provide Python committer’s access to all the different types of platforms Python ran on—especially all the UNIX derivatives from the late 90s to 00s for which I seemed to be genetically predisposed to overly romanticize.\nAnd I came up with the idea for Snakebite as a Python committer, where I found myself often frustrated at trying to debug buildbot breaks on platforms for which I had no access. And becoming a Python committer was an artifact of my involvement with the Python language, particularly with regards to providing buildbots and help with Windows 64-bit Python builds in the early days where AMD64 was still a novelty.\nAnd I was led to Python by a random article by Eric S. Raymond, coupled with growing resentment toward Perl, which I found myself having to use when working with ClearQuest.\nThat’s the reverse chronological history in a nutshell. The next few sections go into more detail chronologically.\n\nBecoming a Python Committer\nFrom around 2000 to 2004, I was writing mostly C, C++, and Perl. I had founded a company with a business partner, Jamie Echlin, called OnResolve, and provided consultancy for an IBM—formerly Rational—change management product called ClearQuest, as well as a number of software products that extended the functionality of ClearQuest. ClearQuest could be customized in two languages: Visual Basic, and Perl. The most prominent software product Jamie and I created was OnMessage, which was a combination of C++ and Perl, and provided enhanced e-mail notification facilities for ClearQuest. Jamie deserves much of the credit for what eventually became known as OnMessage —despite having a quirky Perl coding style I found difficult to work with, he absolutely laid the foundation for the product and the subsequent success we had with it.\nClearQuest, and its version-control counterpart, ClearCase, were ubiquitous in all of the industries that had the most money in the early to mid 2000s. Particularly finance and oil. No-one liked using either of them, they were expensive, required huge teams to maintain and administer, and with the advent of tools like Git and Github (albeit many years later), they are now relegated to the annals of history.\nI was relatively productive with Perl, but I didn’t particularly like it. And I absolutely loathed having to deal with other people’s Perl code. Around late 2004 and 2005, Python arrived on my radar. I remember reading Eric S. Raymond’s Why Python article about Python, and it resonated strongly with me. Coming from Perl, Python just felt simply magical. It was intuitive, easy to read, not cryptic, easy to work with other people’s code, powerful–particularly as a glue language.\nI adored it. I tackled all new projects with Python. I wrote a Python wrapper around ClearQuest named cqpython, which I used to carry out one of my most favorite projects to date: merging two ClearQuest databases into a single instance by auto-generating optimized SQL to conduct the merge at the database level. (This was harder than it sounds, as all ClearQuest databases would start off with the same unique ID offsets, so two otherwise unrelated databases would have almost identical keys for different entities, which needed to be resolved efficiently at merge time.)\nBy 2007-2008, I was bored of ClearQuest—it wasn’t a fun product to work with, nor did it look like it would be a good career move to continue specializing in it; the prices were extortionate, a lot of companies were trying to move off it, and better, cheaper alternatives were popping up.\nHowever, it sure had been lucrative. I was able to enjoy extended periods of not needing to work, and I spent that time on things I was finding really fun, like contributing to Python. I set up a bunch of buildbots for Python, and was particularly interested in getting the 64-bit Windows Python builds “green” on the buildbots I had set up. I think I even paid for the Verisign code signing certificate used for the Python.org official Windows binaries back then (this was still the Python 2.x days).\nThis was back in the day where Martin von Löwis was still an active contributor for Python, and if I recall correctly, the release manager for the Python 2.x series. Martin also maintained the Windows Python builds, a role that was eventually taken over by Steve Dower, who is still doing it to this day.\nIn 2008, I attended PyCon in Chicago. It was my first-ever PyCon. I had a fantastic time, and particularly loved the core Python sprints that happened after the conference. For those that are unaware, this is the one time every year where many of the active Python committers, including Guido, get together in a big conference room and just hack on Python collectively for a few days.\nIt was a bit of a surreal experience, sitting in a room hacking on Python alongside the very founder of Python himself—Guido—plus many other luminaries that actively contributed to the language over the years. I don’t know who took this photo, nor why it appears to have dimensions tailored towards ants, but you can see myself and Michael Ford in the foreground table, Guido in the bright green shirt at the top right table, sitting with Neal Norwitz and Barry Warsaw. And that looks like Brett Canon and Martin von Löwis at the middle table.\n\n\n\nPyCon 2008 Core Sprint\n\n\nI remember inundating Martin with patch bombs fixing various buildbot-related things at the start of that sprint, to which Martin eventually dealt with by simply offering me commit privileges. I enthusiastically accepted! Honestly, that was a career highlight. This was in the days before everything was Github and Pull Requests—becoming a Python committer meant you would literally get svn+ssh access to svn.python.org, plus ssh access to the python.org boxes themselves if you wanted it/needed it (i.e. for buildbot master configuration). This was certainly more compelling than the ClearQuest consultancy I’d done in the past, that’s for sure!\nAs much as I love Git and Github, getting your pull request accepted for an open source project just doesn’t have the same feel as getting offered commit privileges like back in the old days.\n\n\nSnakebite: The Open Source Network\n\n\nThe python-ideas@ asyncore discussion\n\nMy Hunch\n\n\nOffline Discussions with Guido\n\n\n\nThe Genesis of PyParallel\n\nPrior Attempts at Removing the GIL\n\n\nRemoving the GIL without removing the GIL\n\n\n\nWindows, Threading, and Asynchronous I/O\nThe backstory behind that hunch warrants its own article, and I don’t want to detract too much from the purpose of this article, which is to focus on the exciting new primitives available to use via Python 3.13’s free-threading facilities. Suffice to say that circa 2012, having done over a decade of multi-threaded and asynchronous I/O systems programming on UNIX and Windows by that stage, I had pretty strong ideas about how to best write high-performance parallel programs that optimally used multi-threading and asynchronous I/O primitives.\nAnd to the detriment of wide-spread adoption of PyParallel, I was convinced that the sublime facilities provided by the Windows NT kernel for multi-threading and asynchronous I/O\nwithout the restrictions imposed by the Python interpreter’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\ndef get_page_offsets_for_key3(search_string):\n    results = []\n    items = titles.items(search_string)\n    if not items:\n        return results\n    for (key, value) in items:\n        v = value[0]\n        o = uint64(v if v &gt; 0 else v*-1)\n        ix = offsets.searchsorted(o, side='right')\n        results.append((key, int(o-uint64_7), int(offsets[ix]-uint64_11)))\n    return results"

To resolve this issue, you can modify the fetch request to include the mode: 'cors' option. However, this alone might not solve the problem if the server at http://localhost:4444 is not configured to allow requests from your origin.\nHere’s how you can modify the fetch request in src/Wiki.jsx:\nsrc/Wiki.jsx\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SEARCH\n        const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4444/offsets/${value}`);\n=======\n        const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4444/offsets/${value}`, {\n          mode: 'cors'\n        });\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REPLACE\nIf the server is under your control, you will need to configure it to include the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in its responses.

I do have control over it so is it just a matter of adding that header to the server’s output?\nYes, you are correct. The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is a part of the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) mechanism that allows servers to specify which origins are permitted to access their resources. When a web application makes a request to a server that is on a different origin (domain, protocol, or port), the server must include this header in its response to allow the request.\nTo resolve the CORS issue you’re facing, you need to configure your server running on localhost:4444 to include the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in its responses. Here’s how you can do it, depending on the server technology you’re using:\n\n\nFor Express.js (Node.js)\nIf you’re using Express.js, you can use the cors middleware to handle this:\n\nInstall the cors package:\nnpm install cors\nUse the cors middleware in your server setup:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst cors = require('cors');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(cors());\n\n// Your routes here\n\napp.listen(4444, () =&gt; {\n  console.log('Server is running on port 4444');\n});\n\n\n\nFor Other Server Technologies\n\nApache: You can add the following line to your .htaccess file or your server configuration:\nHeader set Access-Control-Allow-Origin \"*\"\nNginx: Add the following line to your server block configuration:\nadd_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';\n\n\n\nImportant Note\n\nThe * wildcard allows any origin to access the resource. This is suitable for development but not recommended for production environments due to security concerns. In production, you should specify the exact origin(s) that are allowed to access your server.\nIf your server needs to handle credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication), you should set Access-Control-Allow-Origin to a specific origin and also include the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header set to true.\n\nBy adding the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to your server’s responses, you should be able to resolve the CORS issue and allow your React application to make requests to the server.\n\nTokens: 4.2k sent, 473 received. Cost: $0.02 message, $0.08 session.\n\n\nWhat would exact origin look like if both servers are running on the host “dgx” but listening on different ports?\nIf both servers are running on the host “dgx” but listening on different ports, you would specify the exact origin by including the protocol, hostname, and port number. For example, if your React application is running on port 3000 and your API server is running on port 4444, you would set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to http://dgx:3000 on your API server.\nHere’s how you can configure it for an Express.js server:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst cors = require('cors');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(cors({\n  origin: 'http://dgx:3000'\n}));\n\n// Your routes here\n\napp.listen(4444, () =&gt; {\n  console.log('Server is running on port 4444');\n});\nThis configuration allows requests from http://dgx:3000 to access resources on your API server running on http://dgx:4444.\n\nTokens: 6.9k sent, 201 received. Cost: $0.02 message, $0.10 session.\n\n\n\n/ask What would the raw HTTP header look like from the server in that case?\n\n\nWhat would the raw HTTP header look like from the server in that case?\nIf you configure your server to allow requests from a specific origin, such as http://dgx:3000, the raw HTTP response header from the server would include the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header specifying that origin. Here’s what the relevant part of the HTTP response headers might look like:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: http://dgx:3000\nThis header tells the browser that the resource can be accessed by web pages from the specified origin (http://dgx:3000). If you have additional CORS-related headers, such as those for handling credentials or specific HTTP methods, they might look like this:\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: http://dgx:3000\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: Specifies the origin that is allowed to access the resource.\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: Indicates whether the response to the request can be exposed when the credentials flag is true.\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: Lists the HTTP methods that are allowed when accessing the resource.\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Lists the headers that can be used when making the actual request.\n\nThese headers are part of the CORS protocol and help manage cross-origin requests securely.\n\nTokens: 4.9k sent, 291 received.

If another key comes in before 1 second, the timer is reset. Only dispatch a search if there has been no typing for at least a second.\nTo implement a one-second delay before dispatching a search request, we can use a debounce technique. This involves setting a timeout that resets every time a new key is pressed.

When I’m typing fast, e.g. if I type Trent fast, where each character is definitely being typed well before a second has elapsed… the app is still dispatching searches for each keystroke. i.e. in the Chrome dev console I can see that 200 fetch requests were dispatched for ‘Tre’, then ‘Tren’, then ‘Trent’. We should be waiting for at least a second to see if there has been any more typing before dispatching a fetch.\nTo ensure that the app waits for at least a second before dispatching a fetch request, we need to adjust the debounce logic in the handleSearch function. Specifically, we should clear the timeout and set a new one only if the user stops typing for a second.\nHere are the changes:\nsrc/Wiki.jsx\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SEARCH\n    setSearchStatus(`Searching for '${value}'...`);\n    \n    if (abortControllerRef.current) {\n      abortControllerRef.current.abort(); // Cancel any ongoing fetch requests\n    }\n\n    if (searchTimeout) {\n      clearTimeout(searchTimeout);\n    }\n\n    if (value.trim().length &gt;= 3) {\n      searchTimeout = setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n        const startTime = performance.now();\n        abortControllerRef.current = new AbortController();\n        const { signal } = abortControllerRef.current;\n        try {\n          fetch(`http://dgx:4444/offsets/${value}`, {\n            mode: \"cors\",\n            signal,\n          })\n            .then((response) =&gt; response.json())\n            .then((data) =&gt; {\n              setResults(data);\n              const endTime = performance.now();\n              const duration = ((endTime - startTime) / 1000).toFixed(2);\n              setSearchStatus(`Received ${data.length} results for '${value}' in ${duration} seconds.`);\n            })\n            .catch((error) =&gt; {\n              if (error.name !== \"AbortError\") {\n                console.error(\"Error fetching search results:\", error);\n                setResults([]);\n              }\n            });\n        } catch (error) {\n          console.error(\"Error fetching search results:\", error);\n          setResults([]);\n        }\n      }, 1000);\n      setSelectedXml(null); // Clear selected XML when the search box is cleared\n    } else {\n      setResults([]);\n    }\n=======\n    if (searchTimeout) {\n      clearTimeout(searchTimeout);\n    }\n\n    if (value.trim().length &gt;= 3) {\n      searchTimeout = setTimeout(() =&gt; {\n        setSearchStatus(`Searching for '${value}'...`);\n\n        if (abortControllerRef.current) {\n          abortControllerRef.current.abort(); // Cancel any ongoing fetch requests\n        }\n\n        const startTime = performance.now();\n        abortControllerRef.current = new AbortController();\n        const { signal } = abortControllerRef.current;\n        try {\n          fetch(`http://dgx:4444/offsets/${value}`, {\n            mode: \"cors\",\n            signal,\n          })\n            .then((response) =&gt; response.json())\n            .then((data) =&gt; {\n              setResults(data);\n              const endTime = performance.now();\n              const duration = ((endTime - startTime) / 1000).toFixed(2);\n              setSearchStatus(`Received ${data.length} results for '${value}' in ${duration} seconds.`);\n            })\n            .catch((error) =&gt; {\n              if (error.name !== \"AbortError\") {\n                console.error(\"Error fetching search results:\", error);\n                setResults([]);\n              }\n            });\n        } catch (error) {\n          console.error(\"Error fetching search results:\", error);\n          setResults([]);\n        }\n      }, 1000);\n    } else {\n      setResults([]);\n      setSearchStatus(\"\");\n    }\n    setSelectedXml(null); // Clear selected XML when the search box is cleared\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; REPLACE\nThis change ensures that the search request is only dispatched if the user stops typing for at least one second, reducing unnecessary fetch requests.\n\nTokens: 6.9k sent, 694 received.

    "text": "The Tracer Project\nOne of the frustrations I had with existing Python profilers was that there was no easy or efficient means to filter or exclude trace information based on the module name of the code being executed. I tackled this in my tracer project, which allows you to set an environment variable named TRACER_MODULE_NAMES to restrict which modules should be traced, e.g.:\nset TRACER_MODULE_NAMES=myproject1;myproject2;myproject3.subproject;numpy;pandas;scipy\nIf the code being executed is coming from the module myproject3.subproject.foo, then we need to trace it, as that string prefix matches the third entry on our list.\nThis article details the custom data structure and algorithm I came up with in order to try and solve the prefix matching problem more optimally with a SIMD approach. The resulting StringTable component is used extensively within the tracer project, and as such, must conform to unique constraints such as no use of the C runtime library and allocating all memory through TraceStore-backed allocators. Thus, it’s not really something you’d drop in to your current project in its current form. Hopefully, the article still proves to be interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code samples provided herein are copied directly from the tracer project, which is written in C and assembly, and uses the Pascal-esque Cutler Normal Form style for C. If you’re used to the more UNIX-style Kernel Normal Form of C, it’s quite like that, except that it’s absolutely nothing like that, and all these code samples will probably be very jarring."

    "text": "The Test Data\nInstead of using some arbitrary Python module names, this article is going to focus on a string table constructed out of a set of 16 strings that represent reserved names of the NTFS file system, at least when it was first released way back in the early 90s.\nThis list is desirable as it has good distribution of characters, there is a good mix of both short and long entries, plus one oversized one ($INDEX_ALLOCATION, which clocks in at 17 characters), and almost all strings lead with a common character (the dollar sign), preventing a simple first character optimization used by the initial version of the StringTable component I wrote in 2016.\nSo the scenario we’ll be emulating, in this case, is that we’ve just been passed a filename for creation, and we need to check if it prefix matches any of the reserved names.\nHere’s the full list of NTFS names we’ll be using. We’re assuming 8-bit ASCII encoding (no UTF-8) and case sensitive. (If this were actually the NT kernel, we’d need to use wide characters with UTF-16 encoding, and be case-insensitive.)\n\nNTFS Reserved Names\n\n$AttrDef\n$BadClus\n$Bitmap\n$Boot\n$Extend\n$LogFile\n$MftMirr\n$Mft\n$Secure\n$UpCase\n$Volume\n$Cairo\n$INDEX_ALLOCATION\n$DATA\n????\n.\n\nThe ordering is important in certain cases. For example, when you have overlapping strings, such as $MftMirr and $Mft, you should put the longest strings first. They will be matched first, and as our routine terminates upon the first successful prefix match—if a longer string resided after a shorter one, it would never get detected.\nLet’s review some guiding design requirements and cover some of the design decisions I made, which should help shape your understanding of the implementation."

The rationale behind this is that shorter strings simply have fewer characters to choose from, while longer strings have more to choose from. If we identified unique characters in the order they appear in the string table, we may have longer strings preceding shorter ones, such that toward the end of the table, nothing unique can be extracted from the short ones.\nThe utility of the string table is maximized by ensuring a unique character is selected from every string; thus, we sort by length first. Note that the uniqueness is actually determined by offset:character pairs, with the offsets becoming the indices stored in the UniqueIndex slot. If you trace through the diagram above, you’ll see that the unique character in each slot matches the character in the corresponding string slot, indicated by the underlying index."

There’s a neat deck called Engineering Better Software at Microsoft which captures some interesting details about SAL, for those wanting to read more. The Code Analysis engine that uses the annotations is built upon the Z3 Theorem Prover, which is a fascinating little project in its own right.\n\n\nAnd finally, we’re left with the smaller helper structs that we use to encapsulate the various innards of the string table. (I use unions that feature XMMWORD representations (which is a typedef of __m128i, representing an XMM register) as well as underlying byte/character representations, as I personally find it makes the resulting C code a bit nicer.)"

The PGO build is faster than the normal release build in every case except one, where it is notably slower.\nIt’s… odd. I haven’t investigated it. The following graph depicts the affected function, IsPrefixOfStringInTable_1, and a few other versions for reference, showing the performance of the PGO build compared to the release build on the input strings \"$INDEX_ALLOCATION\" and \"$Bai123456789012\".\n\n\n\nBenchmark Release vs PGO\n\n\nOnly that function is affected, and the problem mainly manifests with the two example test strings shown. As this routine essentially serves as one of the initial baseline implementations, it would be misleading to compare all optimized PGO versions to the abnormally slow baseline implementation. Therefore, the release and PGO timings were blended into a single CSV, and the Excel PivotTables select the minimum time for a given function and test input.\nThus, you’re always looking at the PGO timings, except for this outlier case where the release versions are faster."

I figured there were a couple of ways I could present this information. First, I could hand-pick what I choose to show and hide, creating a rosy picture that makes it seem like I effortlessly arrived at the fastest implementation without much actual effort whatsoever.\nOr I could show the gritty reality of how everything actually went down in chronological fashion, errors and all. And there were definitely some errors! For better or worse, I’ve chosen this route, so you’ll get to see some pretty tedious tweaks (changing a single line, for example) before the juicy stuff really kicks in.\nAdditionally, with the benefit of writing this section introduction retroactively, iterations 4 and 5 aren’t testing what I initially thought they were testing. I’ve left them in as is; if anything, it demonstrates the importance of only changing one thing at a time and making sure you’re testing what you think you’re testing.

Even without using any SIMD instructions, version 1, the IsPrefixOfStringInTable_1 routine, is faster (in all but one case) than the baseline IsPrefixOfCStrInArray routine, thanks to a more sophisticated data structure.\n(And really, it’s not even using the sophisticated parts of the STRING_TABLE; it’s just leveraging the fact that we’ve captured the lengths of each string in the backing STRING_ARRAY structure by virtue of using the STRING structure to wrap our strings (instead of relying on the standard NULL-terminated C string approach).)\n\nBefore we look at IsPrefixOfStringInTable_2, which is the first of the routines to use SIMD instructions, it’s helpfu to know some backstory. The _2 version is based on the prefix matching routine I wrote for the first version of the StringTable component back in 2016. The layout of the STRING_TABLE struct differed in the first version; only the first character of each slot was used to do the initial exclusion (as opposed to the unique character), and lengths were unsigned shorts instead of chars (16 bits instead of 8 bits), so the match bitmap had to be constructed slightly differently.\nNone of those details really apply to our second attempt at the StringTable component, detailed in this article. Our lengths are 8 bits, and we use unique characters in the initial negative match fast-path. However, the first version used an elaborate AVX2 prefix match routine geared toward matching long strings, attempting to use non-temporal streaming load instructions where possible (which would only make sense for a large number of long strings in specific cache-thrashing scenarios).\nCompare our simpler implementation, IsPrefixMatch, used from version 3 onward, to the far more elaborate (and unnecessary) IsPrefixMatchAvx2:\n\n\nIsPrefixMatch\nFORCEINLINE\nBYTE\nIsPrefixMatch(\n    _In_ PCSTRING SearchString,\n    _In_ PCSTRING TargetString,\n    _In_ BYTE Offset\n    )\n{\n    PBYTE Left;\n    PBYTE Right;\n    BYTE Matched = 0;\n    BYTE Remaining = (SearchString-&gt;Length - Offset) + 1;\n\n    Left = (PBYTE)RtlOffsetToPointer(SearchString-&gt;Buffer, Offset);\n    Right = (PBYTE)RtlOffsetToPointer(TargetString-&gt;Buffer, Offset);\n\n    while (--Remaining && *Left++ == *Right++) {\n        Matched++;\n    }\n\n    Matched += Offset;\n    if (Matched != TargetString-&gt;Length) {\n        return NO_MATCH_FOUND;\n    }\n\n    return Matched;\n}\n\n\nIsPrefixMatchAvx2\nThe AVX2 routine is overkill, especially considering the emphasis we put on favoring short strings over longer ones in the requirements section. However, we want to put broad statements like that to the test, so let’s include it as our first SIMD implementation to see how it stacks up against the simpler versions.\nFORCEINLINE\nUSHORT\nIsPrefixMatchAvx2(\n    _In_ PCSTRING SearchString,\n    _In_ PCSTRING TargetString,\n    _In_ USHORT Offset\n    )\n{\n    USHORT SearchStringRemaining;\n    USHORT TargetStringRemaining;\n    ULONGLONG SearchStringAlignment;\n    ULONGLONG TargetStringAlignment;\n    USHORT CharactersMatched = Offset;\n\n    LONG Count;\n    LONG Mask;\n\n    PCHAR SearchBuffer;\n    PCHAR TargetBuffer;\n\n    STRING_SLOT SearchSlot;\n\n    XMMWORD SearchXmm;\n    XMMWORD TargetXmm;\n    XMMWORD ResultXmm;\n\n    YMMWORD SearchYmm;\n    YMMWORD TargetYmm;\n    YMMWORD ResultYmm;\n\n    SearchStringRemaining = SearchString-&gt;Length - Offset;\n    TargetStringRemaining = TargetString-&gt;Length - Offset;\n\n    SearchBuffer = (PCHAR)RtlOffsetToPointer(SearchString-&gt;Buffer, Offset);\n    TargetBuffer = (PCHAR)RtlOffsetToPointer(TargetString-&gt;Buffer, Offset);\n\n    //\n    // This routine is only called in the final stage of a prefix match when\n    // we've already verified the slot's corresponding original string length\n    // (referred in this routine as the target string) is less than or equal\n    // to the length of the search string.\n    //\n    // We attempt as many 32-byte comparisons as we can, then as many 16-byte\n    // comparisons as we can, then a final &lt; 16-byte comparison if necessary.\n    //\n    // We use aligned loads if possible, falling back to unaligned if not.\n    //\n\nStartYmm:\n\n    if (SearchStringRemaining &gt;= 32 && TargetStringRemaining &gt;= 32) {\n\n        //\n        // We have at least 32 bytes to compare for each string.

Let’s see how they compare. (This is an interesting one, as I genuinely don’t have a strong hunch about what kind of performance impact this will have; obviously, I thought the initial way of structuring the loop was optimal, and I had it in place for two years before deciding to embark on this article, which led to the rework we just saw. )\n\n\nBenchmark 10\n\n\n\nBenchmark 10\n\n\nHey, look at that! We’ve shaved off a few more cycles in most cases, especially for the negative matches!\n\n\n\nSpeeding Up Negative Matches with Assembly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nIf you build the Tracer project, you can run a helper batch file in the root directory called cdb-simple.bat, which uses cdb to launch one of the project’s executables, ModuleLoader.exe. This will start up, load all of our tracing project’s DLLs, then allow the debugger to break in, yielding a debugger prompt from which we can easily disassemble functions, inspect runtime function entries, etc. This is the approach I used for capturing the output over the next couple of sections.\n\n\n\nNow for the fun part! Let’s take a look at the disassembly of the initial part of version 10 responsible for the negative match logic and see if there are any improvements we can make.\n0:000&gt; uf StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10\nStringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10:\n00007fff`f69c1df0 48896c2418      mov     qword ptr [rsp+18h],rbp\n00007fff`f69c1df5 4889742420      mov     qword ptr [rsp+20h],rsi\n00007fff`f69c1dfa 4155            push    r13\n00007fff`f69c1dfc 4156            push    r14\n00007fff`f69c1dfe 4157            push    r15\n00007fff`f69c1e00 4883ec20        sub     rsp,20h\n00007fff`f69c1e04 c5fa6f5920      vmovdqu xmm3,xmmword ptr [rcx+20h]\n00007fff`f69c1e09 4c8b6a08        mov     r13,qword ptr [rdx+8]\n00007fff`f69c1e0d 4d8bf0          mov     r14,r8\n00007fff`f69c1e10 440fb63a        movzx   r15d,byte ptr [rdx]\n00007fff`f69c1e14 33ed            xor     ebp,ebp\n00007fff`f69c1e16 44883c24        mov     byte ptr [rsp],r15b\n00007fff`f69c1e1a 488bf1          mov     rsi,rcx\n00007fff`f69c1e1d c4e279780c24    vpbroadcastb xmm1,byte ptr [rsp]\n00007fff`f69c1e23 c4c17a6f6500    vmovdqu xmm4,xmmword ptr [r13]\n00007fff`f69c1e29 c4e259004110    vpshufb xmm0,xmm4,xmmword ptr [rcx+10h]\n00007fff`f69c1e2f c5f97411        vpcmpeqb xmm2,xmm0,xmmword ptr [rcx]\n00007fff`f69c1e33 c5e164c9        vpcmpgtb xmm1,xmm3,xmm1\n00007fff`f69c1e37 c5f1ef0d41320000 vpxor   xmm1,xmm1,xmmword ptr [StringTable2!_xmmffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff (00007fff`f69c5080)]\n00007fff`f69c1e3f c5e9dbd1        vpand   xmm2,xmm2,xmm1\n00007fff`f69c1e43 c579d7c2        vpmovmskb r8d,xmm2\n00007fff`f69c1e47 c5fa7f5c2410    vmovdqu xmmword ptr [rsp+10h],xmm3\n00007fff`f69c1e4d 4585c0          test    r8d,r8d\n00007fff`f69c1e50 0f849a000000    je      StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10+0x100 (00007fff`f69c1ef0)\nThere’s a bit of cruft at the start regarding setting up the function’s prologue (pushing non-volatile registers to the stack, etc. ). That’s to be expected for C (and C++, and basically every language); as the programmer, you don’t have any direct control over how many registers a compiler uses for a routine, how much stack space it uses, which registers it uses when, etc.\nHowever, with assembly, we’re on the opposite end of the spectrum: we can control everything! We also have a little trick up our sleeves: the venerable LEAF_ENTRY.\n\nWindows x64 ABI Calling Conventions\nFirst, some background. The Windows x64 ABI and calling convention dictate two types of functions: NESTED_ENTRY and LEAF_ENTRY.\n\nNESTED_ENTRY\nNESTED_ENTRY is by far the most common; C and C++ functions are all implicitly NESTED_ENTRY functions. (The LEAF_ENTRY and NESTED_ENTRY symbols are MASM (ml64.exe) macro names, but the concept applies to all languages.)\n\n\nLEAF_ENTRY\nA LEAF_ENTRY can only be implemented in assembly. It is constrained in that it may not manipulate any of the non-volatile x64 registers (rbx, rdi, rsi, rsp, rbp, r12, r13, r14, r15, xmm6-15), nor may it call any other functions (since call implicitly modifies the stack pointer), nor may it have a structured exception handler (since handling an exception for a given stack frame also manipulates the stack pointer).\nThe reason for these constraints is that LEAF_ENTRY routines do not have any unwind information generated for them in their runtime function entries. Unwind information is used by the kernel to, well, unwind the modifications made to non-volatile registers while traversing back up through the call stack looking for an exception handler in the event of an exception.\nFor example, here’s the function entry and associated unwind information for the PGO build of the IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10 function:\n0:000&gt; .fnent StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10\nDebugger function entry 000001d8`2ea03cf8 for:\n(00007fff`f8411df0)   StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10\nExact matches:\n    StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10 (struct _STRING_TABLE *,\n                                             struct _STRING *,\n                                             struct _STRING_MATCH *)\n\nBeginAddress      = 00000000`00001df0\nEndAddress        = 00000000`00001e59\nUnwindInfoAddress = 00000000`000054f8\n\nUnwind info at 00007fff`f84154f8, 14 bytes\n  version 1, flags 0, prolog 14, codes 8\n  00: offs 14, unwind op 4, op info 6   UWOP_SAVE_NONVOL FrameOffset: 58 reg: rsi.\n  02: offs 14, unwind op 4, op info 5   UWOP_SAVE_NONVOL FrameOffset: 50 reg: rbp.\n  04: offs 14, unwind op 2, op info 3   UWOP_ALLOC_SMALL.\n  05: offs 10, unwind op 0, op info f   UWOP_PUSH_NONVOL reg: r15.\n  06: offs e, unwind op 0, op info e    UWOP_PUSH_NONVOL reg: r14.\n  07: offs c, unwind op 0, op info d    UWOP_PUSH_NONVOL reg: r13.\nWe can see that this routine manipulates six non-volatile registers in total, including the stack pointer. The first instructions of the routine constitute the function’s prologue; in the disassembly, you can see that three of the rxx registers are pushed to the stack, followed by the allocation of 0x20 (32) bytes of stack space:\n0:000&gt; uf StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10\nStringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_10:\n00007fff`f69c1df0 48896c2418      mov     qword ptr [rsp+18h],rbp\n00007fff`f69c1df5 4889742420      mov     qword ptr [rsp+20h],rsi\n00007fff`f69c1dfa 4155            push    r13\n00007fff`f69c1dfc 4156            push    r14\n00007fff`f69c1dfe 4157            push    r15\n00007fff`f69c1e00 4883ec20        sub     rsp,20h\nIt also cheekily uses the home parameter space for stashing rbp and rsi instead of pushing them to the stack. That’s fair game, though—this is the PGO build, so I’d expect it to use some extra tricks to shave off a few cycles here and there. I’d do the same if I were writing assembly. (Side note: if you view the source of this page, there’s a commented-out section below that shows the runtime function entry for the release build of version 10; it uses nine registers instead of six and 40 bytes of stack space instead of 32. I wrote it before switching to using the PGO build for everything.)\nThe home parameter space is a 32-byte area that immediately follows the return address (i.e., the value of rsp when the function is entered); it is mandated by the x64 calling convention on Windows and is primarily intended to provide scratch space for a routine to home its parameter registers (i.e., the registers used for the first four arguments of a function: rcx, rdx, r8, and r9). This allows the four volatile registers to be repurposed within a routine while still providing a way to refer to the parameters if needed. That’s its intended use—however, it’s not strictly enforced, so you can essentially treat this area as a free 32-byte scratch space if you’re writing assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn a semi-related note, I’d highly recommend reading A History of Modern 64-bit Computing if you have some spare time. It’s a fascinating insight into contemporary x64 conventions we often take for granted, drawing on numerous interviews with industry luminaries like Dave Cutler and Linus Torvalds. I found it incredibly useful for understanding the why behind concepts like home parameter space, structured exception handling, runtime function entries, and why you can’t write inline assembly for x64 with MSVC anymore—apparently, it provides a direct vector for disrupting the mechanisms relied upon by the kernel stack unwinding functionality. (At least, I think that’s the reason—can anyone from Microsoft confirm?))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Implementations\n\nIsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_1\nIsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_2 →\nSo, knowing what we now know about the venerable little LEAF_ENTRY trick, let’s see if we can construct a simple routine in assembly that just deals with the negative match case.\n;++\n;\n; STRING_TABLE_INDEX\n; IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_*(\n;     _In_ PSTRING_TABLE StringTable,\n;     _In_ PSTRING String,\n;     _Out_opt_ PSTRING_MATCH Match\n;     )\n;\n; Routine Description:\n;\n;   Searches a string table to see if any strings \"prefix match\" the given\n;   search string.

If an exception occurs within the body of our implementation (say we dereference a NULL pointer), the kernel knows it doesn’t have to undo any non-volatile register modifications (using offsets specified by the unwind information) because there isn’t any unwind information. It can simply advance to the frame before us (e. g. , rsp at the time of the fault, minus 8 bytes) as it continues its search for runtime function entries and associated unwind information. As you can see, the unwind info is effectively empty:\n0:000&gt; .fnent StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_1\nDebugger function entry 000001f9`048edf98 for:\nExact matches:\n    StringTable2!IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_1 (void)\n\nBeginAddress      = 00000000`00003290\nEndAddress        = 00000000`000032cb\nUnwindInfoAddress = 00000000`00004468\n\nUnwind info at 00007ffd`15594468, 4 bytes\n  version 1, flags 0, prolog 0, codes 0\n\n\nBenchmark x64 1\nLet’s see how this scrappy little fellow (who always returns NO_MATCH_FOUND but still mimics the steps required to successfully negative match) does against the leading C implementation at this point, version 10:\n\n\n\nBenchmark x64 1\n\n\nFwoah, look at that, we’ve shaved about three cycles off the C version!\n (Note that when I first wrote this, I was comparing the assembly version against the release build (not the PGO build), which was clocking in at about 13-14 cycles for negative matching. So getting it down to ~7.5 from 13-14 was a bit more exciting. Damn the PGO build and its 10.9-ish cycles for negative matching!) \nThe good news is that our theory about the performance of the LEAF_ENTRY looks like it’s paid off: we can reliably get about 7.5 cycles for negative matching.\n\n\nIsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_2\n← IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_1 | IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_3 →\nThe bad news is that we now need to implement the rest of the functionality within the constraints of a LEAF_ENTRY!\nThe problem with a LEAF_ENTRY for anything more than a trivial bit of code is that you only have a handful of volatile registers to work with, and no stack space can be used for register spilling or temporaries. (Technically I could use the home parameter space, but, eh, we’re already avoiding stack spills, why not make life harder for ourselves and try to avoid all memory spilling.)\nIf you can’t spill to memory, your only option is really spilling to XMM registers via vpinsr and vpextr combinations, which, as you can see in the implementation of version 2 below, I have to do a lot.\n (Also note: when I wrote this version, I didn’t use the disassembly from the C routines for guidance. I find that as soon as you start to grok the disassembly for a given routine, it becomes harder to think of ways to approach it from a fresh angle. Also, the LEAF_ENTRY aspect significantly limited what I could do anyway, so I figured I may as well just give it a crack from scratch and see what I could come up with. It would be an interesting point of reference compared to a future iteration that tries to improve on the disassembly of an optimized PGO version, for example.) \nThe diff view for this routine is less useful given the vast majority of the code is new, so I’ve put the full version of the code first. It’s based more or less on the approach used by version 8 of the C routine (I actually wrote it after I wrote version 8; versions 9 and 10 of the C routine (with the latter having the improved loop logic) came after).\n\nFullDiff\n\n\n;++\n;\n; STRING_TABLE_INDEX\n; IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_*(\n;     _In_ PSTRING_TABLE StringTable,\n;     _In_ PSTRING String,\n;     _Out_opt_ PSTRING_MATCH Match\n;     )\n;\n; Routine Description:\n;\n;   Searches a string table to see if any strings \"prefix match\" the given\n;   search string.

Writing assembly is slow; writing correct assembly is even slower. I generally find that there’s a noticeable hump I need to get over in the first, say, 30 minutes of any assembly programming session, but once you get into the zone, things can start flowing quite nicely. I’m an aggressive debugger user; often, to get started, I’ll write a simple LEAF_ENTRY that looks like this:\n    LEAF_ENTRY Foo, _TEXT$00\n        int 3\n        xor eax, eax\n        ret\n    LEAF_END Foo, _TEXT$00\nThat’ll allow me to attach the debugger and at least inspect the parameter registers so I can write the next couple of instructions. I find it definitely helps get me into the zone quicker.\nAnyway, enough about that. Let’s look at performance. Again, this will be an interesting one—other than the optimal negative match logic that I copied from version 1, the sole focus was on getting a working assembly version; I wasn’t giving any thought to performance at this stage.\nSo, it’ll be interesting to see how it compares to a) version 1 in the negative matching case (it should be very close), and b) against the C versions in the prefix matching case (it hopefully won’t be prohibitively worse).\n\n\nBenchmark x64 2: Negative Matching\n\n\n\nBenchmark Negative Match\n\n\nHmmm, that’s not too bad! We’re very close to version 1 for negative matching, within about 0.5 cycles or so. That sounds about right, given that our initial logic had to be tweaked a bit to play nicer with the rest of the implementation. And we’re still about 3-4 cycles faster than the fastest C version.\nWhat about prefix matching performance?\n\n\nBenchmark x64 2: Prefix Matching\n\n\n\nBenchmark Prefix Match\n\n\nThe prefix matching performance isn’t too bad either! We’re definitely slower than the C version, ranging from about 4 cycles to 10 cycles in most cases, with the $INDEX_ALLOCATION input about 13 cycles slower.\n  (I’ve just noticed the pattern with regards to the first 8 entries, $AttrDef to $Mft, clocking in at about 18 and 24 cycles respectively. But the next four entries, $Secure to $Cairo, consistently clock in at about 24 and 34 cycles respectively. $Secure is the 9th slot, which puts it at memory offset 192 bytes from the start of the string table. And then the 18 and 24 cycle behavior returns for the last two items, ???? and ., which are at the end of the string table’s inner slot array. This pattern is prevalent in all of our iterations. Very peculiar! We’ll investigate later.) \n\n\nIsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_3\n← IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_2 | IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_4 →\n(We’re nearly at the end of the first round of iterations, I promise!)\nSeeing the performance of the second version in assembly, I decided to try whipping up a third version, which would switch from a LEAF_ENTRY to NESTED_ENTRY and use rep cmps for the byte comparison for long strings (instead of the byte-by-byte approach used now).\nIn order to use rep cmps, you need to use two non-volatile registers, rsi (the source index) and rdi (the destination index). You also need to specify the direction of the comparison, which means mutating the flags, which are also classed as non-volatile, so they need to be pushed to the stack in the prologue and popped back off in the epilogue.\nI didn’t really expect this to offer a measurable speedup, but it was a tangible reason to use a NESTED_ENTRY, and otherwise allowed me to stay within the confines of the version 2 implementation.\nLet’s take a look at the implementation. At the very least, it’s useful to see how you can go about organizing your prologue in MASM. For NESTED_ENTRY routines, I always define a Locals structure that incorporates the return address and home parameter space for easy access. Mainly because it allows me to write code like this:\n    mov     Locals.HomeRcx[rsp], rcx        ; Home our first param.\n    mov     Locals.HomeRdx[rsp], rdx        ; Home our second param.\n    mov     rsi, Locals.SavedRsi[rsp]       ; Restore rsi.\n    mov     rdi, Locals.SavedRdi[rsp]       ; Restore rdi.\nInstead of working wiht offsets like this:\n    mov     qword ptr [rsp+30h], rcx        ; Home our first param.\n    mov     qword ptr [rsp+38h], rdx        ; Home our second param.\n    mov     rsi, qword ptr [rsp+10h]        ; Restore rsi.\n    mov     rdi, qword ptr [rsp+8]          ; Restore rdi.\nThis routine was written last, after version 10 of the C routine, so it incorporates the slightly re-arranged loop logic that proved to be faster for that version.

Even its negative matching performance is terrible, which is the one thing the assembly versions have been good at so far. How peculiar.\nNow, in the interest of keeping events chronological, as much as I’d like to dive in now and figure out why, I’ll have to defer to my behavior when I encountered this performance gap: I laughed, shelved the version 3 experiment, and moved on.\nThat’s a decidedly unsatisfying end to the matter, though, I’ll admit. We’ll come back to it later in the article and try and get some closure as to why it was so slow, comparatively.\n\n\n\nInternet Feedback\nSo, at this point, with version 10 of the C routine and version 2 of the assembly version in hand, and a very early draft of this article, I solicited feedback on Twitter and got some great responses. Thanks again to Fabian Giesen, Wojciech Muła, Geoff Langdale, Daniel Lemire, and Kendall Willets for their discussion and input over the course of a few days!"

The _mm_testc_si128() alteration was a tiny bit slower for version 12 across the board. However, the vptest (which is the underlying assembly instruction that maps to the _mm_testc_si128() intrinsic) version 4 of our assembly was definitely a little bit faster than the other versions. Let’s see how our final C version performs.\n\n\nBenchmark 14\n\n\n\nBenchmark 14\n\n\nWelp, at least it’s consistent! Like version 12, the _mm_testc_si128() change doesn’t really offer a compelling improvement for version 14. That makes version 13 officially our fastest C implementation for round 2.\n\n\nIsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_5\n← IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_4 | IsPrefixOfStringInTable_x64_6 →\nBefore we conclude round 2, let’s see if we can eke any more performance out of the negative match fast path of our fastest assembly version so far: version 4. For this step, I’m going to leverage Intel Architecture Code Analyzer, or IACA, for short.\nThis is a handy little static analysis tool that can provide useful information for fine-tuning performance-sensitive code. Let’s take a look at the output from IACA for our assembly version 4. To do this, I uncomment the two macros, IACA_VC_START and IACA_VC_END, which reside at the start and end of the negative match logic. These macros are defined in StringTable.inc, and look like this:\nIACA_VC_START macro Name\n\n        mov     byte ptr gs:[06fh], 06fh\n\n        endm\n\nIACA_VC_END macro Name\n\n        mov     byte ptr gs:[0deh], 0deh\n\n        endm\nThe equivalent versions for C are defined in Rtl.h, and look like this:\n//\n// Define start/end markers for IACA.\n//\n\n#define IACA_VC_START() __writegsbyte(111, 111)\n#define IACA_VC_END()   __writegsbyte(222, 222)\nYou may have noticed commented-out versions of these macros in both the C and assembly code. What they do is emit a specific byte pattern in the instruction byte code that the IACA tool can detect. You place the start and end markers around the code you’re interested in, recompile it, then run IACA against the final executable (or library).\nLet’s see what happens when we do this for our version 4 assembly routine. I’ll include the relevant assembly snippet, reformatted into a more concise fashion, followed by the IACA output (also reformatted into a more concise fashion):\n\nAssemblyIACA\n\n\nmov      rax,  String.Buffer[rdx]                       ; Load address of string buffer.\nvmovdqu  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rax]                        ; Load search buffer.\nvmovdqa  xmm1, xmmword ptr StringTable.UniqueIndex[rcx] ; Load indexes.\nvpshufb  xmm5, xmm0, xmm1                               ; Rearrange string by uniq. ix.\nvmovdqa  xmm2, xmmword ptr StringTable.UniqueChars[rcx] ; Load unique chars.\nvpcmpeqb xmm5, xmm5, xmm2                               ; Compare unique chars.\nvmovdqa  xmm3, xmmword ptr StringTable.Lengths[rcx]     ; Load table lengths.\nvpbroadcastb xmm4, byte ptr String.Length[rdx]          ; Broadcast string length.\nvpcmpgtb xmm1, xmm3, xmm4                               ; Identify long slots.\nvptest   xmm1, xmm5                                     ; Unique slots AND (!long slots).\njnc      short Pfx10                                    ; CY=0, continue with routine.\nxor      eax, eax                                       ; CY=1, no match.

What I’m really looking at in this pass is what my block throughput is, and potentially what the bottleneck is.\nIn this case, our block throughput is being reported as 3.74 cycles, which basically indicates how many CPU cycles it takes to execute the block. Our bottleneck is dependency chains, which refers to the situation where, say, instruction C can’t start because the results from instruction A aren’t ready yet.\nAlright, well, what can we do? A good answer would be that with an intimate understanding of contemporary Intel CPU architecture, you can pinpoint exactly what needs changing in order to reduce dependencies, maximize port utilization, and generally make the CPU happier.\nOr you can just move shit around until the number gets smaller. That’s what I did.\nWell, that’s not entirely true. Fabian did make a good suggestion when he was reviewing some of my assembly that I was often needlessly doing a load into an XMM register only to use it once in a subsequent operation. Instead of doing that, I could just use the load-op version of the instruction, which allows for an instruction input parameter to be sourced from memory.\nFor example, instead of this:\nvmovdqa  xmm2, xmmword ptr StringTable.UniqueChars[rcx] ; Load unique chars.\nvpcmpeqb xmm5, xmm5, xmm2                               ; Compare unique chars.\nYou can just do this:\nvpcmpeqb xmm5, xmm5, xmmword ptr StringTable.UniqueChars[rcx] ; Compare...\nBut yeah, other than a few load-op tweaks, I basically just shuffled shit around until the block throughput reported lower. Very rigorous methodology, I know. Here’s the final version, which also happens to be the version quoted in the introduction of this article:\n\nAssemblyIACA\n\n\nmov      rax,  String.Buffer[rdx]                   ; Load address of string buffer.\nvpbroadcastb xmm4, byte ptr String.Length[rdx]      ; Broadcast string length.\nvmovdqa  xmm3, xmmword ptr StringTable.Lengths[rcx] ; Load table lengths.\nvmovdqu  xmm0, xmmword ptr [rax]                    ; Load string buffer.\nvpcmpgtb xmm1, xmm3, xmm4                           ; Identify slots &gt; string len.\nvpshufb  xmm5, xmm0, StringTable.UniqueIndex[rcx]   ; Rearrange string by unique index.\nvpcmpeqb xmm5, xmm5, StringTable.UniqueChars[rcx]   ; Compare rearranged to unique.\nvptest   xmm1, xmm5                                 ; Unique slots AND (!long slots).\njnc      short Pfx10                                ; CY=0, continue with routine.\nxor      eax, eax                                   ; CY=1, no match.\nnot      al                                         ; al = -1 (NO_MATCH_FOUND).\nret                                                 ; Return NO_MATCH_FOUND.\n\n\nS:\\Source\\tracer&gt;iaca x64\\Release\\StringTable2.dll\nIntel(R) Architecture Code Analyzer\nVersion -  v3.0-28-g1ba2cbb build date: 2017-10-23;17:30:24\nAnalyzed File -  x64\\Release\\StringTable2.dll\nBinary Format - 64Bit\nArchitecture  -  SKL\nAnalysis Type - Throughput\n\nThroughput Analysis Report\n--------------------------\nBlock Throughput: 3.48 Cycles       Throughput Bottleneck: FrontEnd\nLoop Count:  24\nPort Binding In Cycles Per Iteration:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Port   |  0  - DV  |  1  |  2  - D   |  3  - D   |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Cycles | 2.0   0.0 | 1.0 | 3.5   3.5 | 3.5   3.5 | 0.0 | 3.0 | 2.0 | 0.0 |\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDV - Divider pipe (on port 0)\nD - Data fetch pipe (on ports 2 and 3)\n* - instruction micro-ops not bound to a port\n^ - Micro Fusion occurred\n\n|    | Ports pressure in cycles        | |\n|µops|0DV| 1 | 2 - D | 3 - D |4| 5 | 6 |7|\n-------------------------------------------\n| 1  |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |   |   | | mov rax, qword ptr [rdx+0x8]\n| 2  |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |1.0|   | | vpbroadcastb xmm4, byte ptr [rdx]\n| 1  |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |   |   | | vmovdqa xmm3, xmmword ptr [rcx+0x20]\n| 1  |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |   |   | | vmovdqu xmm0, xmmword ptr [rax]\n| 1  |1.0|   |       |       | |   |   | | vpcmpgtb xmm1, xmm3, xmm4\n| 2^ |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |1.0|   | | vpshufb xmm5, xmm0, xmmword ptr [rcx+0x10]\n| 2^ |   |1.0|0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |   |   | | vpcmpeqb xmm5, xmm5, xmmword ptr [rcx]\n| 2  |1.0|   |       |       | |1.0|   | | vptest xmm1, xmm5\n| 1  |   |   |       |       | |   |1.0| | jnb 0x10\n| 1* |   |   |       |       | |   |   | | xor eax, eax\n| 1  |   |   |       |       | |   |1.0| | not al\n| 3^ |   |   |0.5 0.5|0.5 0.5| |   |   | | ret\nTotal Num Of µops: 18\n\n\n\nAs you can see, that is reporting a block throughput of 3.48 instead of 3.74. A whopping 0.26 reduction! Also note the bottleneck is now being reported as FrontEnd, which basically means that the thing holding up this code now is literally the CPU’s ability to decode the actual instruction stream into actionable internal work.

    "text": "Implementation Considerations\nOne issue with writing so many versions of the exact same function is… how do you actually handle this? Downstream consumers of the component don’t need to access the 30 different function pointers for each function you’ve experimented with, but things like unit tests and benchmark programs do.\nHere’s what I did for the StringTable component. Define two API structures, a normal one and an “extended” one. The extended one mirrors the normal one, and then adds all of its additional functions to the end.\nI use a .def file to control the DLL function exports, with an alias to easily control which version of a function is the official version. The main header file then contains some bootstrap glue (in the form of an inline function) that dynamically loads the target library and resolves the number of API methods according to the size of the API structure provided.\nThis currently means that the StringTable2.dll includes all 14 C and 5 assembly variants, which is harmless, but it does increase the size of the module unnecessarily. (The module is currently about 19KB in size, whereas it would be under 4KB if only the official versions were included.) What I’ll probably end up doing is setting up a second project called StringTableEx, and, in conjunction with some #ifdefs, have that be the version of the module that contains all the additional functions, with the normal version just containing the official versions.\nHere’s the bootstrap glue from StringTable.h and the StringTable.def file I currently use.

This was then saved as PDF, which I then edited with Inkscape, deleting the surrounding border, cropping the canvas to fit the diagram, and then saving as SVG.\nAfter saving as SVG, I then edited each chart in Vim and manually did some font corrections.

Using a demo project named Parallelopedia, we demonstrate the benefits afforded by the new functionality, whereby large data structures (tens to hundreds of gigabytes) are loaded in main memory and then accessed in parallel from Python—a feat not previously possible with the contemporary multiprocessing approach. Additionally, we investigate multi-threaded, parallel inference (generation) of transformer-based Deep Neural Networks via PyTorch, and explorer the limits of what can and can’t currently be done, as well as a roadmap for future PyTorch support. \n\n\n\n\n\nTrent Nelson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Prefix Of String In Table?\n\n\nA Journey Into SIMD String Processing\n\n\n\nAVX2\n\n\nSIMD\n\n\nC\n\n\nAssembly\n\n\nMASM\n\n\n\nThis article details an approach for efficiently determining if a given string prefix-matches a set of known strings.

This will be populated with\n        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.\n\nReturn Value:\n\n    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.\n\n--*/\n{\n    ULONG Bitmap;\n    ULONG Mask;\n    ULONG Count;\n    ULONG Length;\n    ULONG Index;\n    ULONG Shift = 0;\n    ULONG CharactersMatched;\n    ULONG NumberOfTrailingZeros;\n    ULONG SearchLength;\n    PSTRING TargetString;\n    STRING_SLOT Slot;\n    STRING_SLOT Search;\n    STRING_SLOT Compare;\n    SLOT_LENGTHS Lengths;\n    XMMWORD LengthXmm;\n    XMMWORD UniqueChar;\n    XMMWORD TableUniqueChars;\n    XMMWORD IncludeSlotsByUniqueChar;\n    XMMWORD IgnoreSlotsByLength;\n    XMMWORD IncludeSlots;\n\n    //\n    // Unconditionally do the following five operations before checking any of\n    // the results and determining how the search should proceed:\n    //\n    //  1.
