  This article takes a look at the new no-GIL, free-threading functionality
  introduced in Python 3.13, as well as how it compares and performs against
  PyParallel's attempt at exploiting multiple CPU cores over ten years ago.
  Using a demo project named Parallelopedia, we demonstrate the benefits
  afforded by the new functionality, whereby large data structures (tens to
  hundreds of gigabytes) are loaded in main memory and then accessed in
  parallel from Python---a feat not previously possible with the contemporary
  `multiprocessing` approach.

# Introduction

Since it's inception, Python has had a
[Global Interpreter Lock](
https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock),
or GIL, that prevented more than one thread running Python code at the same
time.

Python 3.13, released in October 2024, is the first version of Python to
introduce support for a "no-GIL" *free-threaded* mode, per
[PEP-703 Making the Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython](
https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/), unlocking the ability for multiple Python
threads to run simultaneously.

This allows, for the first time since the language's inception in December
1989, a single Python process to saturate all CPU cores in parallel with
pure Python code (i.e. not farming out to extension modules written in C, C++,
or, more recently, Rust).

I can’t overstate how exciting this is!  For decades, countless attempts have
been made to solve this problem---including my own efforts with
[PyParallel](https://pyparallel.org)---but no-one has prevailed in getting a
solution mainlined into CPython.  Until now!

I will admit I am biased: I am a Python committer (though I have not been
directly involved in this work, nor have I contributed any changes to Python
recently), I adore the language, and have spent years obsessing over the dream
of a parallel Python.  It's a topic I'm incredibly passionate about, and this
article will unabashedly proselytize the extraordinary engineering efforts
that finally made a free-threaded Python a reality.

Thankfully, it's not just blind, uninformed enthusiasm.  Over the past few
months I've had the opportunity to extensively test-drive free-threaded Python
to prepare for this article.  The verdict?  I think it's phenomenal.  Both the
implementation and performance on real-world problems.  Free-threaded Python
removes a significant limitation, making it possible to tackle a wide range of
problems that were previously out of reach.  I genuinely believe this is the
best thing to ever happen to the Python language over the last three decades,
and it will solidify its position as one of the most dominant programming
languages for the next three decades.  After all, we're not getting fewer
cores.

And this is essentially just the first-pass!  Certain trade-offs had to be made
to deliver the core functionality within a reasonable time frame---like
disabling the non-thread-safe functionality introduced by
[PEP-659 Specializing Adaptive Interpreter](
https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html#whatsnew311-pep659), which is the
feature responsible for delivering large speedups in the last few prior
releases.  However, this is on track to be re-enabled in free-threaded mode
for Python 3.14, allowing multi-threaded code to also benefit from the same
speedups single-threaded code has enjoyed the past few years.

The goal of this article is to review the technical details of the
implementation, with some comparisons to prior work such as PyParallel.  I'll
then cover the types of problems that are now incredibly well-suited to be
tackled with a free-threaded Python, using a demo project I've created called
[Parallelopedia](https://github.com/tpn/parallelopedia) to provide a basis for
concrete examples of real-world problems.

# Background

The [Related Work](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/#related-work) section of
PEP-703 does a fantastic job of capturing all of the past attempts at improving
Python's ability at simultaneously leveraging multiple CPU cores.

In this section I'm going to focus on Greg Stein's initial free-threaded work
back in 1996, and then my attempts around 2012 with PyParallel.

## Greg Stein's Free Threaded Patch (1996)

The first attempt to remove the GIL was by Greg Stein in 1996, with a patch
against Python 1.4.  (1996!  I hadn't even heard of Python back in 1996---I
was only in tenth grade at the time.)

The `python-dev@` mailing lists weren't public until a few years after that,
so we can't see the specific discussions that were had between core Python
developers at the time.  Greg opines on the experience in August 2001 in this
`python-dev@` email titled [Free threading](
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2001-August/017099.html).  Guido
van Rossum also furnishes some pertinent information on the topic in this
September 2007 post titled [It isn't Easy to Remove the GIL](
https://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&thread=214235&start=0&msRange=15).

Greg's approach introduced fine-grained locking to all Python objects, which,
unfortunately, introduced pretty severe performance penalties that were deemed
too great for the patches to ever make it into mainline Python.  With the
patches applied, *all* Python code was slowed down by about 40%-50%, regardless
of whether it was single-threaded or multi-threaded code.

Fast-forward 15 years or so, and David Beazley wrote a detailed post in August
2011 about Greg Stein's work in an article titled: [An Inside Look at the GIL
Removal Patch of Lore](
https://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2011/08/inside-look-at-gil-removal-patch-of.html).
As part of this article, Dave obtains the original Python 1.4 source, applies
Greg Stein's patches, and takes the resulting free-threaded Python for a run.

Dave confirms that, indeed, the slowdown introduced by this approach---where
every increment and decrement reference results in either an interlocked op
or a mutex lock and unlock---is prohibitively expensive.

In writing this article, I reviewed Dave's article again, and attempted to
download Python 1.4 so that I could apply Greg's patches as well.
Unfortunately, the download link Dave cites now 404s, so I googled
*"download Python 1.4 source"*, and, funnily enough, the first hit is a Github repo
titled [tpn/python-1.4](https://github.com/tpn/python-1.4) that, 'lo and
behold, is a repo I put together twelve years ago doing exactly that:

 - [Importing the original Python 1.4
   source](https://github.com/tpn/python-1.4/commit/c6ef13ae4c089eaf8c39942655d65953e6849469)
 - [Applying Greg's
   patches](https://github.com/tpn/python-1.4/commit/5c17e33224e2b57948ab594280a006d7648347e6)

### Python 1.4

Let's take a look at Python 1.4 and the changes Greg made in the first known
effort of someone attempting to remove the Python GIL.  All future efforts at
this herculean task were influenced by Greg's work---specifically, in that he
identified what absolutely doesn't work---so it's valuable to review the core
technical aspects of his free-threading patch.

#### Objects and VarObjects

Python's main object structure, the `PyObject`, hasn't changed much over the
years.  For non-container objects (i.e. scalars such as integers, floats, etc.)
the structure is simply a reference count and a pointer to a type object:

```c
typedef struct {
    int ob_refcnt;
    PyTypeObject *ob_type;
} PyObject;
```

Container objects--otherwise known as *"variable"* objects--are represented
via the `PyVarObject` structure.  These structures *"inherit"* the base
`PyObject` layout, and then add an additional field for tracking the number
of elements contained by the object: the `ob_size` field.  In Python 1.4, the
structure looked like this:

```c
typedef struct {
    int ob_refcnt;
    PyTypeObject *ob_type;
    int ob_size;
} PyVarObject;
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false" title="Actual C Header Code"}
The actual C header code for defining these structures is more baroque; the
relevant Python 1.4 [Include/object.h](
https://github.com/tpn/python-1.4/blob/c6ef13ae4c089eaf8c39942655d65953e6849469/Include/object.h#L104)
code looks like this:

```c
#define PyObject_HEAD \
    int ob_refcnt; \
    struct _typeobject *ob_type;
#define PyObject_HEAD_INIT(type) 1, type,

#define PyObject_VAR_HEAD \
    PyObject_HEAD \
    int ob_size; /* Number of items in variable part */
typedef struct _object {
    PyObject_HEAD
} PyObject;

typedef struct {
    PyObject_VAR_HEAD
} varobject;
```
:::

#### Reference Counting

There was no cyclic garbage collection in Python 1.4--that feature wasn't added
until Python 2.0 around the October 2000 timeframe.  Reference counting was the
only means for Python to reclaim the memory used by objects that were no longer
needed, by way of the `PyObject` `ob_refcnt` field.  Incrementing the reference
simply added one to the existing value.  Decrementing the reference subtracted
one and checked to see if the resulting value was zero, and, if it was, the
object would be deallocated via `_Py_Dealloc()`.

The relevant Python 1.4 [Include/object.h](
https://github.com/tpn/python-1.4/blob/c6ef13ae4c089eaf8c39942655d65953e6849469/Include/object.h#L349C1-L354C18)
code used two macros named `Py_INCREF()` and `Py_DECREF()`, which looked like
this:

```c
#define Py_INCREF(op) ((op)->ob_refcnt++)
#define Py_DECREF(op)           \
    if (--(op)->ob_refcnt != 0) \
        ;                       \
    else                        \
        _Py_Dealloc(op)
```

These operations are inherently unsafe in a multi-threaded environment.  If
two or more separate threads are incrementing or decrementing reference counts
to the same object in parallel, the results are effectively undefined, as there
is no guarantee as to the correctness of the underlying value.

The solution for protecting against this was the Global Interpreter Lock, which
ensured that only one thread could be running Python code at any given time.

Thus, if you're embarking on an attempt to avoid this restriction, such that
you can have multiple Python threads executing Python code simultaneously (i.e.
on multi-core systems), the first thing you need to do is figure out how you're
going to handle making reference counting thread-safe.

### Greg's Free-Threaded Approach

Greg's approach tried the most logical solution: make reference counting
a thread-safe operation by using interlocked increment and decrement
operations against the `ob_refcnt` field on NT (Windows) systems.  On Linux, a
mutex lock was used to protect the reference count.

Using a `WITH_FREE_THREAD` macro to gate his changes, Greg modified the
[reference counting logic](
https://github.com/tpn/python-1.4/commit/5c17e33224e2b57948ab594280a006d7648347e6#diff-87272721a5cf1cd9915d6f503f6a7bbefa2f26c935c7ce83ca78706afd0ad05aR353-R371)
to `Include/object.h` as follows:

```c
#ifdef WITH_FREE_THREAD
#define Py_INCREF(op) Py_SafeIncr(&(op)->ob_refcnt)
#define Py_DECREF(op)                       \
    if (Py_SafeDecr(&(op)->ob_refcnt) != 0) \
        ;                                   \
    else                                    \
        _Py_Dealloc(op)
#else /* !WITH_FREE_THREAD */
#define Py_INCREF(op) ((op)->ob_refcnt++)
#define Py_DECREF(op)           \
    if (--(op)->ob_refcnt != 0) \
        ;                       \
    else                        \
        _Py_Dealloc(op)
#endif /* !WITH_FREE_THREAD */
```

So, `Py_INCREF(op)` became a call to `Py_SafeIncr()`, and `Py_DECREF(op)`
became a call to `Py_SafeDecr()`.  On Windows, these routines were simply
wrappers around the `InterlockedIncrement` and `InterlockedDecrement`
intrinsics, respectively, defined [here](
https://github.com/tpn/python-1.4/commit/5c17e33224e2b57948ab594280a006d7648347e6#diff-9ed9e47e6055e8799816e87f812a456d9d5f37bf32a1973377777184266ff39fR93-R94):

```c
#define Py_SafeIncr(pint)   InterlockedIncrement((long *)(pint))
#define Py_SafeDecr(pint)   InterlockedDecrement((long *)(pint))
```

On non-NT systems, the `Py_SafeIncr()` and `Py_SafeDecr()` routines were
aliased to `_Py_SafeIncr()` and `_Py_SafeDecr()`, respectively, which were
implemented in [Python/pymutex.c](
https://github.com/tpn/python-1.4/commit/5c17e33224e2b57948ab594280a006d7648347e6#diff-3cb31d5133324b025a026d66a2800f91d58736e296776e9f3c24360106eff142R51-R71)
as follows:

```c
/* mutexes for the subsystems */
PyMutex * _Py_RefMutex;
PyMutex * _Py_ListMutex;
PyMutex * _Py_MappingMutex;
PyMutex * _Py_CritMutex;

...

int _Py_SafeIncr(pint)
    int *pint;
{
    int result;
    PyMutex_Lock(_Py_RefMutex);
    result = ++*pint;
    PyMutex_Unlock(_Py_RefMutex);
    return result;
}

int _Py_SafeDecr(pint)
    int *pint;
{
    int result;
    PyMutex_Lock(_Py_RefMutex);
    result = --*pint;
    PyMutex_Unlock(_Py_RefMutex);
    return result;
}
```

Oof!  That's a single global mutex `_Py_RefMutex` protecting all reference
counts for all objects.  (N.B. `PyMutex` was a slim wrapper around
`pthread_mutex_t`, and the lock and unlock operations simply called out to
`pthread_mutex_lock()` and `pthread_mutex_unlock()` respectively.)

Compared to simply incrementing a value in memory by one, locking and
unlocking a mutex is orders of magnitude more expensive, so it's not
surprising that this approach to removing the GIL introduced brutal
slowdowns---not just to new multi-threaded code, but to existing
single-threaded code that wasn't even taking advantage of the fact that there
was now no GIL in place.

Nevertheless, Greg's work tackled a lot of other important concepts which were
mainlined into Python, like separating global state into per-thread state
(something that is still relied upon today).

## PyParallel

### Genesis

#### The python-ideas@ asyncore discussion

In October 2012, there was a discussion on the `python-ideas@` mailing list
titled [asyncore: included batteries don't fit](
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2012-October/016311.html).
The general discussion centered around providing better asynchronous I/O
primitives in Python 3.4, and eventually led to the `async` and `yield from`
keywords being introduced in Python 3.5, released around two years later in
September 2015.

That thread was also the genesis for [PyParallel](https://pyparallel.org); a
fork of Python 3.3.5 that I created to implement a proof-of-concept version of
the Python interpreter that tackled not only asynchronous I/O but also
multi-core parallelism.

There's a comprehensive [backstory](#pyparallel-backstory) section on
PyParallel at the end of this article that goes into more detail.  For now, I
just want to focus on the implementation details of PyParallel compared to
Greg Stein's earlier work, before discussing the free-threading implementation
we now have today in Python 3.13t.

#### Reviewing Existing Attempts

I remember reading David Beazley's [article](
https://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2011/08/inside-look-at-gil-removal-patch-of.html)
and a couple of YouTube videos he'd also done on the topic of the GIL.  I
can't remember if it was in one of his videos (or presentations) or articles,
but I remember him stating something along the lines of *"the GIL is something
every Python committer should be worried about"*, and that really stuck with
me, giving me the initial motivation to embark on the PyParallel project.

The first step I took was to make sure I reviewed Greg's earlier work to see
what did and didn't work in the past.  Clearly, introducing fine-grained
per-object synchronization for reference counts was prohibitively
expensive---the interlocked increment and decrement operations alone were bad
enough, let alone the global `pthread_mutex_t` reference count locks.

#### The Hunch

So, what else could we try?  My hunch was that there was a way to achieve
parallelism within the Python interpreter when framed through the lens of
asynchronous I/O primitives, such as a TCP/IP socket server.  For example,
why couldn't a simple HTTP server be written in such a way that multiple
threads could respond to incoming client requests on multiple cores
simultaneously?

If you think about the type of server-side computation that is required to
process an incoming HTTP request, it's just pretty vanilla Python code.  Sure,
you may create a lot of temporary Python objects in servicing the request, but
they're only short-lived.  Once you send a response back to the client, you
don't need any of those objects anymore.  And you're generally not mutating
global state, so you don't need any thread synchronization primitives during
request processing.

The underlying operating system's kernel is handling all of that for you
behind the scenes (i.e. you can safely `accept()` on multiple threads against
the same `sockaddr_in` on Linux, or `AcceptEx()` against a single completion
port on Windows).

### Implementation

So, as it pertained to reference counting and garbage collection---all
thread-sensitive things that need to be handled very carefully in a GIL-less
Python---with PyParallel, I explored the notion of: *what if we just didn't do
any of that in parallel thread contexts*?

That is, instead of trying to remove the GIL, let's keep the GIL, and instead,
introduce a new concept of a *parallel thread*.  Because if we can come up with
an efficient way to determine if we're a *parallel thread* at any given time,
we can instrument all the thread-sensitive calls like `Py_INCREF()` and
`Py_DECREF()` such that:

 - If we're a *parallel thread*, do X, if not, do Y.
    - X: a thread-safe alternative
    - Y: what we normally do (i.e. when we're holding the GIL)

And as the thread-sensitive calls we need to instrument are ubiquitous---you
really can't do much in Python before needing to `Py_INCREF()` or `Py_DECREF()`
something---the viability of this approach would be entirely contingent upon
finding an efficient way to detect if we're a parallel thread.

#### Detecting Parallel Threads

I introduced a macro named `Py_PXCTX()` for PyParallel that was responsible for
detecting if we were in one of these *parallel threads* (or *parallel contexts*
as I referred to them in the source code).

As PyParallel was a Windows-only proof-of-concept, I was able to leverage an
x64 intrinsic named `readgsdword` to interrogate the current thread's TEB
([Thread Environment
Block](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-teb))
to obtain the current thread ID (which lives at offset `0x48` on x64 Windows).
By comparing this to the known thread ID of the *main thread* (i.e. the thread
holding the GIL), we could determine if we were a parallel thread with a couple
of instructions.

A simplified
[implementation](
https://github.com/pyparallel/pyparallel/blob/branches/3.3-px/Include/pyintrinsics.h#L13)
looked like this:

```c
#define _Py_get_current_thread_id() (__readgsdword(0x48))

static inline
int
_PyParallel_IsParallelContext(void)
{
    return (Py_MainThreadId != _Py_get_current_thread_id());
}
#define Py_PXCTX() (_PyParallel_IsParallelContext())
```

#### Instrumenting Thread-Sensitive Calls

With the ability to quickly determine if we were a parallel thread, we could
instrument all of the thread-sensitive calls to follow the aforementioned
paradigm of:

> If we're a *parallel thread*, do X, if not, do Y.

For reference counting, the *do X* was literally: *do nothing*.  E.g., instead
of the standard Python reference counting mechanics that basically looked
like this:

```c
#define Py_INCREF(op) ((op)->ob_refcnt++)
#define Py_DECREF(op) \
    (--(op)->ob_refcnt == 0 ? _Py_Dealloc(op) : ;)
```

The PyParallel approach would gate the reference counting logic with the
`Py_PXCTX()` macro, along these lines:

```c
#define Py_INCREF(op) (!Py_PXCTX() && ((op)->ob_refcnt++))
#define Py_DECREF(op) \
    (!Py_PXCTX() && (--(op)->ob_refcnt == 0 ? _Py_Dealloc(op) : ;))
```

This is a purposefully-simplified example---the actual `Py_INCREF(op)` and
`Py_DECREF(op)` calls in PyParallel eventually grew debug guards that allowed
me to catch erroneous cases of, for example, the main thread attempting to
mutate the reference count of an object created by a parallel thread.

And in order to ascertain if any given object was created by the Python *main
thread*, or one of these new *parallel thread contexts*, I had to augument the
`PyObject` structure to capture additional state information.

#### Changes to PyObject

I made three changes to `PyObject`:

1. A field I could fill with a sentinel value that unambiguously indicated
   [from whence it came](https://apps.npr.org/arrested-development/joke-39.html)
   (i.e. a main thread or parallel thread): `void *is_px`.
1. A flags field I could store pertinent per-object state in:
   `size_t px_flags`.
1. A pointer to the object's original type object: `PyTypeObject *orig_type`.
   In some situations, we would override an object's type with a
   parallel-specific shim type that could intercept certain operations.

Technically, the `is_px` field was redundant once I introduced the `px_flags`
field, as we could track whether or not an object was a parallel object by way
of a single flag bit, so I could have shaved off 8 bytes by removing it.

I kept it in because a) I never got around to removing it, and b) it was helpful
when debugging, as the `is_px` field was initialized to one of two
`0xDEADBEEF`-style sentinel values, shown below, which made it very easy to
eyeball in the debugger when traipsing through memory or crash dumps.

```c
#define _Py_DEADBEEF 0xdead1234beef5678 /* is_px when main thread */
#define _Px_DEADBEEF 0x9876beef5432dead /* is_px when parallel thread */
```
A side-by-side comparison of the 64-bit Python 3.3 `PyObject` structure and
the equivalent PyParallel `PyObject` structure is shown below:

<div class="side-by-side-struct-layout">
<div class="side-by-side-struct-column">

<pre>PyTypeObject &#42;ob_type
(8 bytes)</pre>
</div></div>

</div>
</div>

The standard Python 3.3 `PyObject` structure size on 64-bit platforms was
16 bytes.  The PyParallel `PyObject` changes introduced three 64-bit, 8-byte
fields---an extra 24 bytes---for a combined total of 40 bytes.

When coming up with a solution for a parallel Python (that doesn't experience
prohibitive slowdown compared to normal Python code), there are four main
things you need to focus on handling, which we'll cover in the next sections:

1. Reference counting.
1. Memory allocation.
1. Memory reclamation.
1. Garbage collection.

#### Reference Counting

My hunch regarding reference counting was simple: *let's just not do it and see
what happens*.  Such rigorous engineering!  Again, I was keen on targeting
the very narrow domain of an asynchronous I/O-based TCP/IP socket server, like
a HTTP server, where none of the objects that are created as part of servicing
an incoming request need to persist once we've sent bytes back on the wire to
the client.

Additionally, if you think about the flow of a Python program that launches a
HTTP server, you'll have a main thread that does all of the module importing,
setting up any global state, handling configuration, command line arguments,
etc.  Once all of that is done, it'll launch the HTTP server, and use some
form of event loop that allows it to serve incoming clients *forever*, until
process termination.

The code responsible for handling those incoming client requests is very
reactionary: you identify what path the client is requesting, figure out how
you're going to *route* that request (i.e. are they asking for a literal file
system file, or is this an endpoint that will be serviced by Python code?),
and then respond to it accordingly.

You're not mutating global state (such as adding values to a global or
non-local container object (`list`, `dict`, etc.)) in these callbacks.

Finally, you can be assured that for all of the objects you rely upon as
part of your request processing (i.e. HTTP URL parsing libraries, application
configuration objects, etc.), by the time you're interacting with those
objects in your callback: a) they will have reference counts way above one,
and b) there won't be any other code running that could possibly result in
those reference counts ever hitting zero.  Those objects are effectively
*immortal* for the duration of your parallel callback, as far as you're
concerned.

So who cares about incrementing and decrementing reference counts for objects
we know are guaranteed to stay resident throughout the duration of our
parallel callback?  By avoiding reference counting entirely, we eliminate the
need to figure out a way to increment and decrement reference counts between
shared objects in a thread-safe manner---which was the death-knell of Greg
Stein's approach in 1996.

But what about reference counts for objects we create solely during our
parallel thread callbacks?  Remember, the whole point of an object's reference
count is to ensure the object *"stays alive"* until it is no longer needed,
with *"no longer needed"* being unambiguously indicated when an object's
reference count hits zero.

However, because our parallel callback code has a very finite and well-defined
lifetime, all we really need to ensure is that all of the objects we create in
these parallel contexts stay alive for the duration of the callback.

That is, we know our parallel context starts when, for example, we call the
user's `data_received()` routine, and we know it ends when that routine
returns bytes back to us which we then send back to the client.

As long as we can intercept the memory allocation and reclamation routines in
these parallel contexts, we can precisely control object lifetime without the
need for reference counting.

#### Memory Allocation

So, when I hit the point I needed to write a thread-safe memory allocator that
would kick-in to service memory allocation requests in these parallel contexts,
I picked the easiest thing I could think of: just give each parallel thread
its own thread-local block allocator.  This allocator would furnish all memory
allocation requests that we intercepted by instrumenting calls like
`PyObject_New` and `PyMem_Malloc`.

Block allocators are about the simplest memory allocator you can have: you have
a pre-allocated block of memory (say, 4KB, or one page), a request comes in for
120 bytes, you capture the address of the current block pointer, increment it
by 120 bytes, then return the captured address.  If you exceeded 4KB, another
page would be allocated and linked to the existing page, such that you'd have
a doubly-linked-list of blocks from which allocations would be carved out.

Prior to executing the user's callback via `PyObject_CallObject()` in a
parallel thread, we would issue a `snapshot = PxContext_HeapSnapshot(ctx)`,
which would *"snapshot"* the state of the block allocator prior to executing
the user's Python code in parallel; we would then be able to restore this
`snapshot` upon completion of that code.

#### Memory Reclaimation

How do you free memory associated with individual objects allocated in these
parallel contexts?  Well, because you're not doing any reference counting,
you have no knowledge of when any given object is no longer required at any
arbitrary point within a parallel callback's execution.

And even if you did, because you're using a block allocator that isn't built
to handle unused allocations being returned to it, there isn't anything you
could do anyway.

However, what you do know, with absolute certainty, is when that user's
parallel callback has finished executing, because you'll be sitting back in
the Python interpreter's C code, having just returned from a call to a routine
like `PyObject_CallObject()`.

And because you captured a snapshot of the thread-local block allocator (or
heap) via `snapshot = PxContext_HeapSnapshot(ctx)`, prior to your call to
`result = PyObject_CallObject(...)`, once you're finished handling the
returned `result` (i.e. sending it back to the client via a socket `send()`
call), you can reset the block allocator back to its starting position prior
to the call via `PxContext_RollbackHeap(ctx, snapshot)`, effectively
reclaiming all memory allocated in that parallel context in one fell swoop.

This all worked pretty well for PyParallel.  I believe it was the first time
anyone had experimented with the notion of *"let's just not do any reference
counting and see what happens"*, and I was genuinely pleased that my hunch
that it would all work out turned out to be true.

Additionally, as back-to-back execution of callbacks on the same thread would
be continually using the same block allocator, and thus, the same blocks and
corresponding virtual addresses---you'd reap all the benefits you'd expect
from frequently using the same addresses: increased likelihood of cache hits
and TLB hits, vastly-reduced likelihood of page faults.

This all worked because socket-server callbacks are pretty short-lived; you're
not allocating gobs of memory for objects with ambiguous lifetimes.  You're
doing lots of little allocations with very clear lifetimes: the allocations
will cease to exist once the callback returns.

It wasn't perfect.  You obviously couldn't persist the objects past the
lifetime of the parallel callback, as that memory was getting continually
reset.  And if you had a stray callback allocating a disproportionately high
amount of memory, you'd end up with many page-sized blocks chained together
that would have no way of getting returned to the operating system when no
longer needed.

But as far as proof-of-concepts go, it all worked pretty well.  The last thing
to tackle was garbage collection.

#### Garbage Collection

A nice side-effect of not doing any reference counting is that you can't
create cyclic references between objects in the first place, which obviates
the need to do any garbage collection.  Thus, PyParallel's solution for
handling parallel garbage collection is simply: don't do it, it's not needed.

#### Async I/O

The workhorse of PyParallel was the [PxSocket_IoLoop](
https://github.com/pyparallel/pyparallel/blob/branches/3.3-px/Python/pyparallel.c#L8603-L10642),
some 2,000+ lines of hideous C state-machine-esque hackery that drove the
*completion-oriented* protocol callbacks implemented by the user.

The protocol objects you had to use for PyParallel were similar to the
current-day [Protocol](
https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html#protocols)
Python objects used by `asyncio`.

An example of what a TCP/IP socket server might look like in PyParallel
follows.  Note that no `transport.send()` routines were exposed, if you wanted
to send bytes back to the client, you literally had to return a Python `bytes`
object from your callback---this would then be sent back to the client in the
most optimal fashion.

```python

class MyProtocol:
    # Used if you want to send static bytes to the client first.
    initial_bytes_to_send = b'Hello (Server v1.0)'

    def connection_made(self, transport):
        # Used if you need to send dynamic bytes to the client
        # as soon as they connect.
        return b'Hello, the current time is ' + time.gmtime()

    def data_received(self, transport, data):
        # Called when data is received from the client.  Perform
        # your request processing here and then return bytes to
        # send back to the client.
        return b'You sent: ' + data

    def connection_lost(self, transport):
        # Called when the client disconnects.
        pass

# Create the TCP/IP socket server object (PxSocket).  (PyParallel
# initially exposed all of its parallel functionality by way of an
# `async` module, which obviously predated the introduction of the
# `async` keyword in Python, so the following code wouldn't be
# valid in a modern Python 3.5+ context.)
server = async.server('0.0.0.0', 8080)

# Register the server (transport) and protocol with the underlying
# async machinery.  Note that this will start serving clients
# immediately, without waiting for `async.run()`.
async.register(transport=server, protocol=MyProtocol)

# Enter the async I/O loop.
async.run()
```

### Limitations

PyParallel, was, in essence, a proof-of-concept project I predominantly hacked
together over the course of about three months during a very cold Michigan
Winter in 2012-2013.

It had many limitations, especially the first pass in that 2012-2013 timeframe.
I spent a few months sprinting on it again around 2015, and addressed some of
the egregious limitations like not being able to use generators in parallel
contexts, and not being able to persist objects created within a parallel
context outside of that context (i.e. `foo['key'] = bar`, where `foo` is a
`dict` created in the *main thread* context).

I also got it to a point where it could compete in a subset of the
[TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks](
https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#hw=ph&test=fortune&section=data-r22),
including non-trivial ones like accessing a `PyODBC` data source in a parallel
context.

Nevertheless, the remaining limitations relegated PyParallel to being somewhat
similar to [Stackless Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stackless_Python),
which was a nichè variant of Python that separated the C call stack from the
Python call stack, but never had a chance of getting mainlined into Python.

(Unlike Stackless, though, which had actual users like [Eve
Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Online), I am not aware of anyone
using PyParallel for anything.  I certainly never got any support requests for
it.)

The next few sections capture some of the limitations that I presume kept
PyParallel from becoming anything other than a proof-of-concept.  Thankfully
I have the luxury of writing about the failures some ten years after I wrote
the underlying code, so I'm inherently less defensive about its egregious
shortcomings as I would have been back then.

#### Parallel Code Has To Be Entered Via Protocol Callbacks

By design, I never intended to support *"free-threaded"* Python, i.e. you
would never be able to create Python `threading.Thread` objects yourself,
instead, you'd have to use the machinery provided to you by PyParallel,
such as `async.server()`, `async.submit_work()`, etc.  (This was before
`async` became a keyword in Python.)

The fact that the only thing that really worked properly was a TCP/IP-based
socket server speaks volumes to the lack of general applicability of the
solution.

#### You Couldn't Do A Lot Of Things In Parallel Callbacks

You couldn't import modules in parallel callbacks.  This wasn't a huge
limitation, you'd simply work around this by making sure you import all the
modules you need at startup, before you launch your server.

You couldn't call routines of modules that used a lot of caching.  Pandas is a
great example of this: there is a prolific amount of behind-the-scenes caching
that happens in Pandas (or at least the version I was experimenting with circa
2015) when interacting with `DataFrame` objects.  This just flat-out did not
work in PyParallel---trying to persist parallel objects past the callback
lifetime completely went against the grain of how PyParallel was initially
architected to work.

You couldn't leverage PyParallel to, for example, load large data structures
in parallel.  Because there was no free-threading support, nor was memory
allocated in these parallel callback contexts intended to persist after the
callback completed---you couldn't spin up a bunch of threads to load some
expensive data structures in parallel (i.e. reading pickles, etc.).

This is actually one of the patterns that I have enjoyed exploiting the
most in the new free-threaded Python as its such a huge win for very little
effort.  I'll cover this more later.

#### Third-Party Libraries Required Recompilation

As PyParallel was based off Python 3.3, a lot of the great work that has since
been done regarding sanitizing the Python C ABI wasn't done yet, so modules
with C code doing raw `Py_INCREF()` and `Py_DECREF()` calls would need to be
recompiled to ensure they use the new PyParallel definitions.

This particular limitation is no different to the current state of affairs
with Python free-threading: modules that need intimiate knowledge of C Python
internals need to be recompiled at the very least, and sometimes will need
additional code changes to ensure correct behavior when operating in a No-GIL
environment.

#### The Code Was... Hideous

I hadn't looked at the [pyparallel.c](
https://github.com/pyparallel/pyparallel/blob/branches/3.3-px/Python/pyparallel.c)
code in a long time prior to writing this article.  Boy, it doesn't hold up
particularly well, in my opinion.  It's very clearly hacky proof-of-concept
code that realistically had no chance of getting mainlined into Python.

You can peruse all of the changes required to convert Python 3.3.5 into
PyParallel by reviewing the [diffs](
https://github.com/pyparallel/pyparallel/tree/branches/3.3-px/diffs) folder,
which I populated with diffs against base 3.3.5 sources and PyParallel
counterparts.  The patches to files like [Include/object.h](
https://github.com/pyparallel/pyparallel/blob/branches/3.3-px/diffs/Include/object.h.patch)
I find most interesting, as they contain most of the *"thread-sensitive
interception"* functionality I was reliant upon.

#### It Was Windows-only

I attribute the *success* of PyParallel---if we define success as being able
to hack together a proof-of-concept that basically worked in about 2-3
months---to Windows.  There are a couple of reasons for this, which I'll
capture in the next sections.

Ironically, I suspect the Windows-only aspect also contributed heavily to the
*failure* of PyParallel, given that, as far as I'm aware, no-one played around
or experimented with it, and it basically didn't seem to move the GIL needle
at all.  (Although I was pleased to see it at least got a shout-out in the
[Related Work](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/#related-work) section of
PEP-703, and there are parallels (heh) to some of the design decisions I made
for PyParallel in the new Free-Threading work.)

I thought at the time that it would be novel and interesting enough to
nerd-snipe a few people into downloading it and messing around, but apparently
not.

I do remember some engineers from Instagram reaching out and asking
about the viability of PyParallel on Linux, but alas, I didn't have a good
answer for that, given how heavily dependent it was on Windows-only features.

##### Thread Pool APIs and Asynchronous I/O

First, I made extensive use of the
phenomenal [Thread Pool API](
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/thread-pool-api)
introduced in Windows Vista.  It is hard to succinctly capture just how
sophisticated this particular API is, especially when paired with the NT
kernel's incredibly robust asynchronous I/O primitives, particularly the
seminal `OVERLAPPED` structure and the [Completion Port](
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/i-o-completion-ports)
scaffolding.

If you're interesting in learning more about asynchronous I/O on Windows,
[slide
47](https://speakerdeck.com/trent/pyparallel-how-we-removed-the-gil-and-exploited-all-cores?slide=47)
of my PyParallel PyData 2013 deck is a great place to start.

So, I used the thread pool facilities to manage all thread dispatching for
PyParallel.  I didn't have to create any threads myself, nor did I ever intend
to support individual Python *free-threading* threads created via Python's
`threading.Thread` facilities.  There are simply no good cross-platform
threadpool alternatives that have equivalent functionality to what is provided
by Windows, and a lot of that is because other operating systems just don't
have the kernel mechanisms in place to support things like thread-agnostic
I/O, or true asynchronous I/O at the driver level via I/O request packets (or
`Irps` as they're colloquially called in kernel development circles).  Neither
Wine nor ReactOS have attempted to implement the Windows Thread Pool API,
which I also found to be an interesting data point.

For the TCP/IP socket-server primary use case, enabled by the
`PxSocket_IoLoop()` workhorse described earlier, overlapped-versions of all
the socket primitives were used where possible.  There aren't any exact
equivalents to these functions on platforms like Linux, the BSDs, or Mac OS.

All of those platforms support non-blocking read and write socket
operations---which is the foundation upon which concurrency is achieved when
combined with a multiplexing operation like `select()`, `poll()`, `epoll()`,
or `kqueue`.  But there is no way to dispatch a socket `read()` or `write()`
call *asynchronously* in conjunction with a request for the OS to invoke a
callback you provide when that asynchronous operation completes (or fails).

Nor do any of these platforms have anything remotely close to the secret
sauce behind what makes I/O completion ports so special: the ability to
specify a completion port's desired concurrency, where the kernel itself
will ensure that an optimal number of threads will be actively scheduled
whilst servicing a completion port.  I touch on this subject a little bit
on [slide 50](
https://speakerdeck.com/trent/pyparallel-how-we-removed-the-gil-and-exploited-all-cores?slide=50),
and go into more detail around [slide 62](
https://speakerdeck.com/trent/pyparallel-how-we-removed-the-gil-and-exploited-all-cores?slide=62).

::: {.callout-note}

`io_uring` is an exception: it absolutely allows asynchronous submission of a
whole range of system calls, but it doesn't introduce a thread-agnostic I/O
model, nor have any kernel participation in concurrency modulation like I/O
completion ports, nor have any native thread pool integration (as there is no
equivalent to the Windows Thread Pool API on any platform, Linux included).

Generally, leveraging `io_uring` in a multi-threaded environment on a
contemporary Linux system would involve spinning up your own threads and
setting up individual completion queues for each thread.  There's no concept
of multiple threads sharing a queue in a kernel-integrated, thread-agnostic
manner.  Which is fine, as that's a very Windows NT kernel solution to the
problem---it just isn't how UNIX-derived operating systems are designed to
work.

I am not disparaging `io_uring` in the slightest here; it is a fantastic
additional to the Linux kernel that is orders of magnitude better than prior
options for async I/O.

The point of mentioning all of this is that there isn't feature parity between
`io_uring` and the Windows features I leveraged in making PyParallel, so it
would still require significant engineering effort to port PyParallel to
non-Windows platforms.  And thankfully that's not something we'll ever have to
embark upon, as the cross-platform Python Free-Threading implementation is a
far better solution to the multi-core Python problem than PyParallel ever was!

(Also, for what it's worth, `io_uring` wasn't available in 2012 when I started
hacking on PyParallel; it first appeared in the Linux kernel 5.1 in May 2019.)

:::

The point of all of this is to convey that PyParallel wasn't just Windows-only
because I didn't have the time or inclination to try compile it on other
platforms---it extensively used APIs for which there are *still* no equivalent
counterparts on other platforms, some thirteen or so years later.

So, if you were to try get PyParallel working on Linux or Mac OS X, for
example, you'd need to write a whole bunch of thread pool and synchronization
scaffolding, as well as `PxSocket_IoLoop()`-equivalents using whatever the
underlying platform's optimal socket multiplexing system call was.

##### Visual Studio Debugger

The other element of developing PyParallel on Windows that I consider crucial
to its success (again, defining success as *getting a proof-of-concept working
in about 2-3 months*) was Visual Studio's sublime debugging facilities.

Microsoft has always invested heavily in fantastic debugger experiences.  This
includes usermode application debugging via tools like Visual Studio, all the
way up to kernel debugging via Windbg.

The first week or two of PyParallel's development was simply stepping through
the Python C code line-by-line in Visual Studio's debugger, building up a
mental model of exactly how the interpreter worked at the lowest-level when
executing a Python program.  I didn't write a line of code during this initial
exploratory period---I was genuinely just traipsing through the debugger
observing how Python *worked* and building up my situational awareness and
mental model.  Incredibly valuable experience, by the way.  It's my favorite
way of getting up to speed with an unfamiliar code base.

Visual Studio Code is pretty good at debugging C programs visually these days
on non-Windows platforms---I certainly used it a lot at Voltron on our Theseus
product, which was exclusively in Linux and C++.  However, Visual Studio Code
didn't appear until 2015, whereas my initial PyParallel hacking was toward the
end of 2012.

Once I started actually writing code for PyParallel, again, the Visual Studio
debugger was indispensable.  Particularly due to how frequently I'd be
crashing in the course of normal development, heh.  It was incredibly handy
with a few mouse clicks to be able to freeze all threads OTHER than the one
you were interested in, step execution through that, then resume, etc.  You
can do all of this via `gdb` and `lldb` when doing console debugging on
UNIX-ish platforms, but it's definitely not as convenient as a full-featured
IDE for debugging.

### Performance

Now, for all its limitations and ultimate market failure, PyParallel excelled
at the one thing it was designed to do well: async I/O-oriented TCP/IP
servers, where users would implement protocol classes that featured
*completion-oriented* callbacks, and those callbacks could be run
simultaneously on multiple cores without any egregious slowdown (i.e. compared
to normal, single-threaded Python code); i.e.: in parallel.

There was negligible overhead introduced by instrumenting all of the
thread-sensitive macros, nor the thread-safe alternates for reference counting
(don't do it), garbage collection (don't do it), memory allocation (simple
block allocator), and memory reclamation (reset block allocator after a
callback has completed).  Collectively, this all ensured that the new parallel
context Python code ran just as fast, if not faster, than normal
single-threaded Python code.

Remember, the prior approach by Greg Stein (some sixteen years prior) where
fine-grained locking was introduced at the individual object level made
**all** Python code run about 40% slower, not just new multi-threaded code.

So PyParallel at least demonstrated that you could get a mostly-functional
parallel version of Python without incurring prohibitive slowdown to all code.

The PyParallel [Performance](https://pyparallel.org/#performance) section of
the website features some concrete metrics that I captured back in 2015 with
whatever hardware I had lying around at the time.

My favorite metric was that PyParallel's plaintext benchmark (basically a
HTTP server that responded to `/plaintext` with a plain text `Hello, World!`
response) performance yielded 132,772 requests per second which put it into
first place across all the platforms I benchmarked.

LWAN, a raw C Linux implementation well-known for its performance, came in
second with 128,126 requests per second.  Granted, I cheated on my side,
leveraging an SSE-accelerated HTTP parser to process the incoming request, per
the `http11 = True` line below:

```python
# PyParallel (Fast)
# (Uses picohttpparser's SSE-accelerated HTTP parser.)
import async
class Plaintext:
    http11 = True
    def plaintext(self, transport, data):
        return b'Hello, World!'

server = async.server('0.0.0.0', 8080)
async.register(transport=server, protocol=Plaintext)
async.run()
```

So the only Python code actually being executed in this example was the
`return b'Hello, World!'` line, which is so simple its basically a no-op.
Thus, the only thing I was really demonstrating there was the performance of
the `PxSocket_IoLoop()` implementation, plus the underlying Windows threadpool
and async I/O facilities.

The *slow* version featured a full HTTP request parser written in Python,
which clocked in at 53,455 requests per second (which was still significantly
higher than other pure-Python implementations like Tornado).

### More Information

I've omitted a lot of PyParallel details on purpose---this section is long
enough as it is!  If you're interested in learning more, I'd recommend the
following deck which I presented at PyData 2013 in New York City:

# Python Free-Threading

So far we've covered Greg Stein's initial attempts at removing the GIL back in
1996, plus my attempts at removing the GIL limitations without actually
removing the GIL via PyParallel around 2012-2013.  I've introduced four
main categories of things that need to be tackled when attempting to solve
the parallel Python problem:

 1. Reference counting.
 2. Garbage collection.
 3. Memory allocation.
 4. Memory reclamation.

Funnily enough, the [Overview of CPython Changes](
https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/#overview-of-cpython-changes) section in
PEP-703 also lists four categories, albeit slightly different:

> The implementation changes can be grouped into the following four categories:
>
> - Reference counting *(and garbage collection)*
> - Memory management
> - Container thread-safety
> - Locking and atomic APIs

I didn't spend time discussing how *Container thread-safety* was tackled by
Greg in his work, nor how I tackled it in my PyParallel work.  Here's a quick
recap: Greg used a single global mutex to protect container objects (i.e.
lists, dicts), and I did all kinds of hacky type interception that required
you to explicitly *"protect"* a global or non-local `list` or `dict` object
via `async.protect(obj)`.  Greg's approach was slow but correct, my approach
was fast but kinda' sucked, and would crash the Python interpreter if you
didn't use it properly.  Thankfully, the requisite engineering elbow-grease
was applied for the free-threading work and a fast *and* correct solution
(that doesn't kinda' suck) was obtained.

[PEP-703](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/) goes into great detail on all
aspects of the free-threaded implementation, from motivation to very detailed
descriptions of the implementation.  I highly recommend reading it if you've
gotten this far so you can see how all the obstacles I've been discussing were
overcome.

I'll spend a little bit of time in this next section covering some of the key
points of the free-threading implementation, particularly as it pertains to
the things that were done differently to Greg Stein's work and PyParallel
regarding reference counting, garbage collection, memory, etc.

After that, we'll take a look at some non-trivial examples of real-world
problems that can now be tackled performantly.

## Implementation

Much like PyParallel, the Free-Threading Python work needed to augment the
standard `PyObject` structure in order to support the new thread-safe
functionality in lieu of the traditional single Global Interpreter Lock.

Let's review these changes first, focusing solely on 64-bit Python builds.

### Changes to PyObject

#### Python 3.13 PyObject

The standard Python 3.13 `PyObject` struct is semantically identical to the
one we introduced earlier in the Python 1.4 [Objects and VarObjects](
#objects-and-varobjects) section (albeit with types tweaked to support 64-bit
architectures):

```c
typedef __int64 Py_ssize_t;

typedef struct {
    Py_ssize_t ob_refcnt;
    PyTypeObject *ob_type;
} PyObject;

typedef struct {
    PyObject ob_base;
    Py_ssize_t ob_size;
} PyVarObject;
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false" title="Actual C Header Code"}
The *actual* C header code used to define the `PyObject` structure in Python
3.13 is much more verbose these days.  It can be found in [Include/object.h](
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.1/Include/object.h#L163) and
looks like this:

```c
struct _object {
#if (defined(__GNUC__) || defined(__clang__)) \
        && !(defined __STDC_VERSION__ && __STDC_VERSION__ >= 201112L)
    // On C99 and older, anonymous union is a GCC and clang extension
    __extension__
#endif
#ifdef _MSC_VER
    // Ignore MSC warning C4201: "nonstandard extension used:
    // nameless struct/union"
    __pragma(warning(push))
    __pragma(warning(disable: 4201))
#endif
    union {
       Py_ssize_t ob_refcnt;
#if SIZEOF_VOID_P > 4
       PY_UINT32_T ob_refcnt_split[2];
#endif
    };
#ifdef _MSC_VER
    __pragma(warning(pop))
#endif

    PyTypeObject *ob_type;
};

typedef struct {
    PyObject ob_base;
    Py_ssize_t ob_size; /* Number of items in variable part */
} PyVarObject;
```

`PyVarObject` remains simple, as can be seen.

:::

The visual depiction of `PyObject` in Python 3.13 64-bit is the same as
before, with a total structure size of 16 bytes:

<div class="struct-layout">
<div class="struct-cell py-field" style="grid-column: span 8;">
<pre>Py_ssize_t ob_refcnt
(8 bytes)</pre>
</div>
<div class="struct-cell py-field" style="grid-column: span 8;">
<pre>PyTypeObject &#42;ob_type
(8 bytes)</pre>
</div>
</div>

#### Free-Threaded PyObject

The new `PyObject` structure in the Free-Threaded build has grown numerous
new fields, and lives below the GIL version in [Include/object.h](
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.1/Include/object.h#L207),
reproduced below (with supporting typedefs):

```c
// Only the two least significant bits are used; remaining bits
// always zero.

typedef struct {
    uint8_t _bits;
} PyMutex;

typedef struct {

    // ob_tid stores the thread id (or zero). It is also used
    // by the GC and the trashcan mechanism as a linked list
    // pointer and by the GC to store the computed "gc_refs"
    // refcount.
    uintptr_t ob_tid;           // thread id
    uint16_t _padding;          // ob_flags in 3.14+
    PyMutex ob_mutex;           // per-object lock
    uint8_t ob_gc_bits;         // gc-related state
    uint32_t ob_ref_local;      // local reference count
    Py_ssize_t ob_ref_shared;   // shared (atomic) reference count
    PyTypeObject *ob_type;
} PyObject;
```

N.B. The `_padding` field has been renamed to `ob_flags` in Python 3.14+.

A visual depiction of the Free-Threaded PyObject structure on 64-bit
architectures follows.  The object size has grown an additional 16 bytes
from the with-GIL `PyObject`, doubling the total structure size to 32 bytes.

<div class="struct-layout">
<div class="struct-cell ft-field" style="grid-column: span 8;">
<pre>uintptr_t ob_tid
(8 bytes)</pre>
</div>
<div class="struct-cell ft-field" style="grid-column: span 2;">
<pre>uint16_t
ob_flags
(2 bytes)</pre>
</div>
<div class="struct-cell ft-field" style="grid-column: span 1;">
<pre>PyMutex
ob_mutex
(1 byte)</pre>
</div>
<div class="struct-cell ft-field" style="grid-column: span 1;">
<pre>uint8_t
ob_gc_bits
(1 byte)</pre>
</div>
<div class="struct-cell ft-field" style="grid-column: span 4;">
<pre>uint32_t
ob_ref_local
(4 bytes)</pre>
</div>
<div class="struct-cell ft-field" style="grid-column: span 8;">
<pre>Py_ssize_t ob_ref_shared
(8 bytes)</pre>
</div>
<div class="struct-cell py-field" style="grid-column: span 8;">
<pre>PyTypeObject &#42;ob_type
(8 bytes)</pre>
</div></div>

If you've followed along with the prior work exposition earlier in the
article, you can probably take a pretty educated guess as to not only what
the new fields are for, but also, why they were needed.

##### Object Thread ID: `uintptr_t ob_tid`

This field captures the thread ID of the owning thread for any given object.
I like this!  I also like how this particular value is obtained, because it
means you can quickly check if *you* own the thread by comparing an object's
thread ID with your own, as follows:

```c
static inline uintptr_t
_Py_ThreadId(void)
{
    uintptr_t tid;
    tid = __readgsqword(48);
    return tid;
}

static inline int
_Py_IsOwnedByCurrentThread(PyObject *ob)
{
    return ob->ob_tid == _Py_ThreadId();
}
```
Hey!  Look at that, it uses the same technique PyParallel used to determine
the current thread ID with the least amount of overhead possible.  I'm not
sure if the idea was sourced from PyParallel or not; if not, it's at least a
good example of [convergent evolution](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution)---that is, if you need to
quickly determine the ID of the current thread, well, there's really only one
optimal way of doing it per platform.

## PyParallel Backstory {#pyparallel-backstory}

I'm not sure how interesting this section will be to readers, which is why I've
stashed it at the end of the article.  The older I get---especially now that I
have a daughter---the more cathartic it is reminiscing about the early parts of
my career some nearly-two-decades-ago.

This section captures the backstory behind PyParallel.  PyParallel was born out
of a) my interest in asynchronous I/O and multithreaded programming, and b) my
experience with Snakebite, an "open source network" I built with the goal to
provide Python committer's access to all the different types of platforms
Python ran on---especially all the UNIX derivatives from the late 90s to 00s
for which I seemed to be genetically predisposed to overly romanticize.

And I came up with the idea for Snakebite as a Python committer, where I found
myself often frustrated at trying to debug buildbot breaks on platforms for
which I had no access.  And becoming a Python committer was an artifact
of my involvement with the Python language, particularly with regards to
providing buildbots and help with Windows 64-bit Python builds in the early
days where AMD64 was still a novelty.

And I was led to Python by a random article by Eric S. Raymond, coupled with
growing resentment toward Perl, which I found myself having to use when working
with ClearQuest.

That's the reverse chronological history in a nutshell.  The next few sections
go into more detail chronologically.

### Becoming a Python Committer

From around 2000 to 2004, I was writing mostly C, C++, and Perl.  I had founded
a company with a business partner, Jamie Echlin, called
[OnResolve](https://web.archive.org/web/20080704070902/http://www.onresolve.com/home/),
and provided consultancy for an IBM---formerly Rational---change management
product called [ClearQuest](https://www.ibm.com/products/rational-clearquest),
as well as a number of software products that extended the functionality of
ClearQuest.  ClearQuest could be customized in two languages: Visual Basic, and
Perl.  The most prominent software product Jamie and I created was OnMessage,
which was a combination of C++ and Perl, and provided enhanced e-mail
notification facilities for ClearQuest.  Jamie deserves much of the credit for
what eventually became known as
[OnMessage](https://web.archive.org/web/20080622060654/http://www.onresolve.com/products/onmessage/)
---despite having a quirky Perl coding style I found difficult to work with, he
absolutely laid the foundation for the product and the subsequent success we had
with it.

ClearQuest, and its version-control counterpart, ClearCase, were ubiquitous in
all of the industries that had the most money in the early to mid 2000s.
Particularly finance and oil.  No-one liked using either of them, they were
expensive, required huge teams to maintain and administer, and with the advent
of tools like Git and Github (albeit many years later), they are now relegated
to the annals of history.

I was relatively productive with Perl, but I didn't particularly like it.  And
I absolutely loathed having to deal with other people's Perl code.  Around late
2004 and 2005, Python arrived on my radar.  I remember reading Eric S.
Raymond's [Why Python](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3882)
article about Python, and it resonated strongly with me.  Coming from
Perl, Python just felt simply magical.  It was intuitive, easy to read, not
cryptic, easy to work with other people's code, powerful--particularly as a glue
language.

I adored it.  I tackled all new projects with Python.  I wrote a Python wrapper
around ClearQuest named [cqpython](https://github.com/tpn/cqpython), which I
used to carry out one of my most favorite projects to date: merging two
ClearQuest databases into a single instance by auto-generating optimized SQL
to conduct the merge at the database level.  (This was harder than it sounds,
as all ClearQuest databases would start off with the same unique ID offsets,
so two otherwise unrelated databases would have almost identical keys for
different entities, which needed to be resolved efficiently at merge time.)

By 2007-2008, I was bored of ClearQuest---it wasn't a fun product to work with,
nor did it look like it would be a good career move to continue specializing in
it; the prices were extortionate, a lot of companies were trying to move off it,
and better, cheaper alternatives were popping up.

However, it sure had been lucrative.  I was able to enjoy extended periods of
not needing to work, and I spent that time on things I was finding really fun,
like contributing to Python.  I set up a bunch of buildbots for Python, and
was particularly interested in getting the 64-bit Windows Python builds "green"
on the buildbots I had set up.  I think I even paid for the Verisign code
signing certificate used for the Python.org official Windows binaries back then
(this was still the Python 2.x days).

This was back in the day where Martin von Löwis was still an active contributor
for Python, and if I recall correctly, the release manager for the Python 2.x
series.  Martin also maintained the Windows Python builds, a role that was
eventually taken over by Steve Dower, who is still doing it to this day.

In 2008, I attended PyCon in Chicago.  It was my first-ever PyCon.  I had a
fantastic time, and particularly loved the core Python sprints that happened
after the conference.  For those that are unaware, this is the one time every
year where many of the active Python committers, including Guido, get together
in a big conference room and just hack on Python collectively for a few days.

It was a bit of a surreal experience, sitting in a room hacking on Python
alongside the very founder of Python himself---Guido---plus many other
luminaries that actively contributed to the language over the years.  I don't
know who took this photo, nor why it appears to have dimensions tailored
towards ants, but you can see myself and Michael Foord in the foreground table
(dark maroon t-shirt on the left and orange t-shirt on the right, respectively),
Guido in the bright green shirt at the top right table, sitting with Neal
Norwitz and Barry Warsaw.  And that looks like Brett Canon in thinking pose in
the dark t-shirt and Martin von Löwis sitting next to him scratching his head
at whatever Brett was doing at the middle table :-)

![PyCon 2008 Core Sprint](images/pycon2008-chicago-core-sprints.jpg)

I remember inundating Martin with patch bombs fixing various buildbot-related
things at the start of that sprint, to which Martin eventually dealt with by
simply offering me commit privileges.  I enthusiastically accepted!  Honestly,
that was a career highlight.  This was in the days before everything was Github
and Pull Requests---becoming a Python committer meant you would literally get
svn+ssh access to svn.python.org, plus ssh access to the python.org boxes
themselves if you wanted it/needed it (i.e. for buildbot master configuration).
This was certainly more compelling than the ClearQuest consultancy I'd done in
the past, that's for sure!

As much as I love Git and Github, getting your pull request accepted for an
open source project just doesn't have the same feel as getting offered commit
privileges like back in the old days.


# Colophon {#colophon}

As much as I enjoy reading technical articles, I often find myself equally
interested in the tools the author used in the production of the article.  In
this final section, I attempt to capture details regarding the tools used to
author this article, in no particular order.

## Quarto & Markdown

This article was written in Markdown using [Quarto](https://quarto.org).  The
source code is
[here](https://github.com/tpn/website/edit/main/articles/from-pyparallel-to-python-free-threading/index.qmd);
there's also an *Edit this page* link on the top-right of the page, under the
contents (assuming you're viewing the site on a wide-enough device).

For the syntax color scheme, I copied the
[`dracula.theme`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/80bf6b5848bf644de3a4d59e26b5eb067375986a/src/resources/pandoc/highlight-styles/dracula.theme)
from the Quarto repository into
[`tpn.theme`](https://github.com/tpn/website/blob/main/tpn.theme) and then
just hacked on it until I was mostly content with the results.

My whole [trent.me](https://trent.me) website uses Quarto, and is hosted
publicly on Github at my [website](https://github.com/tpn/website) repo.
I also leverage Github's hosting facilities via their "Pages" functionality,
the configuration of which can be seen below.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false" title="Github Pages Configuration"}
![Github Pages Configuration for tpn/website](images/github-tpn-website-pages.png){.lightbox}
:::

"Development" on the website (i.e. writing articles like this one) is done
on a variety of boxes, typically all Linux/WSL2.  Quarto has a useful preview
feature, so my local workflow is usually just something as simple as:

```bash
% cd ~/src/website
% quarto preview
```

I edited this `index.qmd` page predominantly in vim, although I'd sometimes use
VS Code and the Quarto extension with integrated previewing.  I generally turn
Copilot off in vim when writing pure text, it's too distracting, and isn't
geared toward writing new prose versus coding tasks, which is obviously its
bread and butter.

## AI Tooling

In general, I for one welcome our new AI overlords.  I have heavily integrated
Copilot and ChatGPT into my workflow now as a developer for the past two years
or so, and I thoroughly enjoy leveraging both tools.

### LM Studio

[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) has also left a lasting impression and I've
enjoyed experimenting with it a lot recently too.  This has been aided by
having a local box at home with 256 GB RAM, 40 cores, four Tesla V100 32GB
GPUs, and a 14TB RAID0 stripe---plenty of room to download all of these huge
models coming out.

A nice thing about LM Studio is that with a few clicks you can expose a local,
OpenAI-compatible REST interface.  LM Studio is powered by
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).

### Aider

I came across [Aider](https://aider.chat) recently.  Aider is, to quote their
website, directly, *AI pair programming in your terminal*.  It's pretty neat,
and I played around with having it drive a little bit of the Python development
in the [parallelopedia](https://github.com/tpn/parallelopedia) repo, and a lot
of the development in the
[parallelopedia-ui](https://github.com/tpn/parallelopedia-ui) repo, which is
the React, Bootstrap, JavaScript/JSX web UI seen in this article.

i'm not a web developer, I don't know how to write web apps, I don't care about
code quality of web apps I do write (as I'm not writing anything other than
demos or small little tools), so, whatever gets the job done is fine.  However,
I am, by trade, a software engineer, so a lot of the core skill set still
**commutes** when working in foreign domains.  *Especially* these days when you
have AI an alt-tab away, or, in the case of Aider, available in a terminal to
carry out your development requests.

The biggest issue I had with Aider was honestly just biting the bullet and
just trying it.  *Begin, the rest is easy* as they say.  It's definitely
not perfect--I had to jump in and fix things a few times every session I had
with it, but we're talking maybe five interventions within a 3-4 hour coding
session, give or take.  It was particularly good at generating scaffolding that
I could hack further with a single sentence.  And it was really good at writing
an entire Python unit test module for me based on a single-sentence.

To get started with Aider:

```bash
% python -m pip install aider-install
% aider-install
# Restart shell, or `export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH`
% which aider
/home/trent/.local/bin/aider
# I've got my OpenAI keys in a GPG-encrypted file ~/.zsh/openai_key.asc.
% which init_openai_key
init_openai_key () {
    if [ -f ~/.zsh/openai_key.asc ]
    then
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(
            gpg -d --batch --quiet ~/.zsh/openai_key.asc
        )
    fi
}
% init_openai_key
% aider --model gpt-4o --vim
```
It was trivial to point it at a local model hosted by LM Studio, too, after
enabling the *Developer* view and starting a local development server (which
will default to hosting on `http://<hostname>:1234/v1`):

```bash
% LM_STUDIO_API_KEY=notused \
  LM_STUDIO_API_BASE=http://$(hostname):1234/v1 \
    aider --model lm_studio/qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct@fp16 --vim
```

By default, Aider keeps a Markdown transcript of your sessions in a file named
`.aider.chat.history.md` in the root of the repository you're working with.  I
have included the transcript from my
[parallelopedia-ui](https://github.com/tpn/parallelopedia-ui) repo below.  I
haven't edited it, so it contains all my mistakes and errors and whatnot.
